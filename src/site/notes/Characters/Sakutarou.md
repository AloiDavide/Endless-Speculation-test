# Descriptions

## Alliance
#### Future

[[Characters/Maria\|Maria onee-chan]]’s precious friend.
Very simple, warm and kind.

Tends to say “Uryuu”.

Didn’t Maria onee-chan also have a habit of saying this, long ago?
#### Tea Party

The beloved furniture of [[Characters/Maria\|Lady MARIA]], a witch of [[Tips/Mariage Sorcière\|Mariage Sorcière]].

He is Lady MARIA's white heart itself. You might even say he's a second Lady MARIA and irreplaceable to her.

He holds a decoration as a diplomat, and none may attack him, not any of the witches, weapons, and furniture in the alliance, nor any of the demons and divine spirits in a contract with the alliance.

[[Characters/Maria\|Lady MARIA]]'s white heart, which was torn apart.

His broken vessel can only be regenerated by the Meister who created him, [[Characters/Rosa\|ROSA]].

However, ROSA disposed of the vessel's fragments and even lost the pattern paper. On top of that, his existence was denied by the Meister herself, so his resurrection is now impossible.

The Meister died in 1986, and any chance for his resurrection disappeared for all time.

Even the [[Speculation/Endless Witch\|Endless Witch]], [[Characters/Beatrice\|Beatrice]], could not manage it......

> [!note]- Kawabata found the second Sakutarou after the tragedy
> The object Ange sees on display in the room of [[Characters/Kawabata\|Captain Kawabata]]'s grandchild is another Sakutarou. It was plausibly taken to Rokkenjima by [[Characters/Rosa\|Rosa]] who was planning to give it to [[Characters/Maria\|Maria]], then the captain found it and brought it back after the storm.

> - It's the knowledge she will later use to get Beatrice out of her golden land. She knew he could be revived because she saw it unlike Maria and Beatrice.
> - It was in the room of a child.
