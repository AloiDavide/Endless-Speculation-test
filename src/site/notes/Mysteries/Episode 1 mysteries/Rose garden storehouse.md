## Axioms
No actual reds here, but it's affected by:
- __I guarantee the identities of all unidentified corpses. Therefore, there were no body double tricks!__

According to Kanon:
- The storehouse shutter can only be opened with a single special key. There are no master keys or spare keys for it.  
This is not red but there isn't much of a reason to doubt it.

## Corollaries

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



> [!note]- Shannon isn't dead in Legend
> The supposed corpse of [[Characters/Shannon\|Shannon]] isn't hers and it also isn't a corpse. That is only her dress on some dummy shover in a dark corner of the shed so nobody would see it clearly. 
> [[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]] is right there in the room reacting to the scene, but she's playing the role of [[Characters/Kanon\|Kanon]]. Eva, Hideyoshi and Nanjo are actively trying to hide this fact and don't allow the kids to get closer to her.

> Leads:
> - One seemingly dead person working with the other servants is the most straight forward answer to most mysteries Legend throws at you, and Shannon's corpse is the only one where you could pull a stunt like this. 
> - Not only that, but looking at the narration and circumstances of the body, it's like the whole scene is screaming: "Look out! There's some deception going on here!"
> -  We mainly just need a way to get around the definition of unidentified corpse. We can beat the red by simply claiming that there was never any corpse to identify.

An older theory requiring the presence of a 17th person whose information has been expunged from the records until the release of Turn theory.

> - Does the motive make any sense with the whole murder going on? Would this be the priority of a bunch of greedy but otherwise innocent people? And are the kids really the ones to whom this secret needs to be kept?
> - We would rather \[REDACTED\] not be in Legend because it breaks another theory.
