# Descriptions

## Legend
#### Rokkenjima

A servant hired as a cook.

He hasn’t served this family long, but through his earlier jobs and previous experience, he has cultivated a talent for entertaining guests. Because of this, he is very highly regarded as a servant.

---
His corpse was found inside the [[Mysteries/Episode 1 mysteries/Rose garden storehouse\|Rose garden storehouse]]. His face seems to have been smashed after his death.

How unfortunate. Apparently, he was originally supposed to be on duty in the [[Mysteries/Guesthouse\|Guesthouse]].
## Turn
#### Rokkenjima

A servant hired as a cook.

He hasn’t served this family long, but through his earlier jobs and previous experience, he has cultivated a talent for entertaining guests. Because of this, he is very highly regarded as a servant.

---
Died in [[Mysteries/Natsuhi's room\|Mysteries/Natsuhi's room]], with his chest pierced by a weapon shaped like [[Characters/The Seven Stakes of Purgatory\|stake]].  

At the fifth twilight, gouge the chest and kill.  

The cook was cooked.  
Kihihihihi.
## Banquet
#### Rokkenjima

A servant hired as a cook.

He hasn’t served this family long, but through his earlier jobs and previous experience, he has cultivated a talent for entertaining guests. Because of this, he is very highly regarded as a servant.

---
His corpse was found in a [[waiting room\|waiting room]] on the third floor. The weapon used on him is assumed to be a [[gun or spear-shaped object\|gun or spear-shaped object]].  

The room next to the study is fitting for him, considering how much he wanted to earn [[Characters/Kinzo\|Kinzo]]'s favor.
## Alliance
#### Rokkenjima

A servant hired as a cook.

He hasn’t served this family long, but through his earlier jobs and previous experience, he has cultivated a talent for entertaining guests. Because of this, he is very highly regarded as a servant.

---
His corpse was found in the [[Mysteries/Episode 1 mysteries/Rose garden storehouse\|Rose garden storehouse]].  
It's assumed that he was hung by the neck after being shot in the forehead.  

They put ropes around their own necks.  
That can be a pretty interesting experience now and then. 
# Theories


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



> [!note]- Gohda is innocent and was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
> Poor [[Characters/Gohda\|Gohda]] was just dragged into all this mess and is doing his best to survive.
> When he doesn't die immediately he's being knocked around and/or threatened by the other servants, and does a poor job of hiding it.
> 
> ---
> Leads:
> - In the mysteries of the [[Mysteries/Crime scene of the Chapel\|Chapel]] and the [[Mysteries/Servant Room\|Servant Room]] there are scenes where deception is most likely at play, however in both cases Gohda is the only person not necessarily in on the trick.
> - In both [[Episodes/Turn of the Golden witch\|turn]] and [[Episodes/Alliance of the Golden witch\|alliance]] he implies he witnessed a magical scene, but he can't say anything coherent. He isn't following a script, he had to make something up.
> - He's even used as a test subject. [[Tips/Notes from a Certain Chef\|Notes from a Certain Chef]] is about the other servants testing their ability to scare people using the witch stories before the real event.

> [!note]- Gohda doesn't know Kinzo is dead.
> He never shows any signs of being aware of it and never has a scene with him, which makes sense given his position.

> [!note]- Gohda knows about Sayo's double identity.
> He probably knows Kanon and Shannon are the same person.
> 
> ---
> Leads:
> - He interacts with both in several scenes (weak evidence on its own but it compounds).
> - It would be difficult to hide it from a fellow servant.
> - According to the theory, the Shannon Kanon thing is something Kinzo was pushing, and Gohda would go along with whatever his employer wants. This doesn't stop him from disliking Kanon though, after all he's getting outranked twice by the same kid.

He knows the 7 stakes of purgatory in an (allegedly) non canon side story.

He has been working in Rokkenjima for two years (shorter than [[Characters/Kanon\|Kanon]])
