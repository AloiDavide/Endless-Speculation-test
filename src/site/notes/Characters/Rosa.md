# Descriptions

## Legend
#### Rokkenjima

[[Characters/Kinzo\|Kinzo]]’s fourth child.

She is by far the youngest of the four siblings. It seems that this gives her a weaker position at the family conference.

She manages a design company, but she has yet to start taking it seriously, and its financial situation is far from favorable.

---
Her corpse was found inside the [[Mysteries/Episode 1 mysteries/Rose garden storehouse\|Rose garden storehouse]]. Her face seems to have been smashed after her death.

I’ll get to see her again. So I don’t feel lonely.
## Turn
#### Rokkenjima

[[Characters/Kinzo\|Kinzo]]’s fourth child.

She is by far the youngest of the four siblings. It seems that this gives her a weaker position at the family conference.

She manages a design company, but she has yet to start taking it seriously, and its financial situation is far from favorable.

---
Missing.  

In the Golden Land, she finally found a treasure more precious than gold.  
However, it only lasted a brief time.  
Because of a fool, she was forced to once again lose what she had finally found.  

Afterwards, she was chewed into a pulp by demons and went to hell.
## Banquet
#### Rokkenjima

[[Characters/Kinzo\|Kinzo]]’s fourth child.

She is by far the youngest of the four siblings. It seems that this gives her a weaker position at the family conference.

She manages a design company, but she has yet to start taking it seriously, and its financial situation is far from favorable.

---
Died in the [[Mysteries/Episode 3 mysteries/Crime scene in the rose garden\|rose garden]] with her medulla oblongata pierced by the spear-shaped part of the fence.  
If [[Characters/Maria\|Maria]]'s death hadn't been a clear homicide, it may have been possible to suspect an accidental death in Rosa's case.  

This woman was the human sacrifice for the birth of the new witch.
## Alliance
#### Rokkenjima

[[Characters/Kinzo\|Kinzo]]’s fourth child.

She is by far the youngest of the four siblings. It seems that this gives her a weaker position at the family conference.

She manages a design company, but she has yet to start taking it seriously, and its financial situation is far from favorable.

---
Her corpse was found in the [[Mysteries/Dining hall\|Dining hall]].  
About half of her head was destroyed. It's probably reasonable to assume that she was murdered with a [[powerful gun\|powerful gun]] or something similar.  

However, the witnesses don't believe she was killed with a gun...
# Theories

Crunter is convinced Rosa smuggled some gold ingots into Rokkenjima because she doesn't want [[Characters/Gohda\|Gohda]] to handle her luggage.
