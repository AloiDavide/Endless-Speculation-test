__There are five master keys, one for each servant.__
__No life form other then humans have any connections to this game__.
__Absolutely no factors other then humans participated in this game board__!


- [x] Why is the difficulty level equal in Banquet?
Maybe Sayo lost control of the operation. I think that Sayo is having to deal with the fact that EVA Beatrice is being a loose cannon in the board.
- [x] Who writes the character descriptions in banquet?
First Beatrice, then EVA Beatrice
- [x] Who was talking with Virgilia at the start?
- It's Sayo, that sees Kinzo as her grandparent, because he was the responsable figure for [[Characters/0 Beatrice\|0 Beatrice]], her mother. Or he just adopted her and she doesn't know about this.
- Alternatively it's [[Characters/0 Beatrice\|0 Beatrice]], the age gap with Kinzo was probably large enough to call him grandfather. This works because the scene with Virgilia seems to take place in Kuwadorian going off of the house in the backgrounds of both flashbacks. If that isn't Kuwadorian this is a major continuity error by the adaptation team.
- In the Meta she is both people so she can be Sayo and also reminisce about her childhood in kuwadorian.
- [x] Who is Evato?
Either Kasumi or someone we don't know.
- [x] Are student Evato and Dress evato different people? Does the same person always give the letter to Maria?
I think they are different people, and probably in turn X Beatrice gives the letter.
- [x] Does it matter that Kinzo throws the ring after they give the letter to Maria?
I don't think so?
- [x] Why was the letter given?
It's the start of the game for Sayo, she wants to meticously craft a magic narrative.
- [x] Who is the beato that gave the letter to Maria?
In this case it's Sayo.
- [x] What happened back then in Kuwadorian?
0 Beatrice is there instead of Beatrice. the same is all identical.
- [x] Who died in the cliff?
0 Beatrice
- [ ] The futon on the servant room seems slept on, but it's not warm
- [x] Red sings on the doors
It's simply Sayo's way to say "It's magic"
- [x] Why are the keys the adults look for not there?
They are in the rooms
- [x] Why do the phones not work?
Either Sayo's gang dabotaged them or the Adults are lying about attempting to call
- [x] Why do they forbid George from looking at Shannon's body?
At least some of the adults are in on Sayo's plan
- [x] What about the new letter they find?
It's to craft the magic narrative
- [x] Is the sweetfish river a genealogic tree?
We can't say for sure, but we don't think so.
- [x] Why does Eva look for an atlas?
It's not sure she does, she looks for a book
- [ ] WHAT THE FUCK DOES THE EPITAPH MEAN
- [ ] What's the sweetfish river
- [ ] What's the book Eva consulted
- [ ] What's the keyhole
- [ ] What's the word that if red in a different way is made of 6 charachters
- [x] Why did Rosa suddenly shut Maria off?
Rosa is in on some pact with Sayo, but she gets killed anyway
- [x] Why did Maria say that she'll quite if she can see her Rose? Why did Rosa comply? Did that scene really happen?
Rosa is in on some pact with Sayo, but she gets killed anyway
- [x] How did Rosa and Maria die?
They were killed by Kasumi. She is allowed to get close becuase she's with Sayo, that a deal with Rosa. She pushes her on the fence and then chokes Maria. Sayo is very upset at the fact that no magic effects were used at all, and also she's probably mad at how brutally Maria was killed.
- [x] Why does Eva not want George to leave the guesthouse? she says something about a witch, but it might just be her worrying and having a fever
She's delirious. For that reason, she bought the witchy narrative.
- [x] Why does Kyrie propose Rudolph to go outside?
She sees the butt of a cigarette on Rosa's crime scene. It's Hideyoshi's brand, but it's actually being smoked by Kasumi.
- [x] What does Beato mean when she tells Evato that magic stops existing when you stop respecting it?
It means that if you don't feed the narrative, people will start believing it's an human culprit.
- [x] Why does the X beato portrait suddenly appear for a moment?
We have absolutelly no idea. we think it's a mistake, or something like that. If it has a meaning, we couldn't find it. X Beatrice was not supposed to be there.
- [x] Why does Geroge go downstairs to take a coffee?
He wants to take a coffee. He is instead pushed outside of the window by Nanjo
- [x] What happened to george? how did he get down?
He is pushed outside of the window by Nanjo and killed by whoever was down there, Sayo or Kasumi.
- [x] What happened to Krauss and Natsuhi? how did they get down?
Krauss has some kind of deal with Beatrice, but he's killed instead by Kasumi
- [x] Why is 07151129 written on the door of the parlor in red paint? Eva writes down the number
That number was for Krauss, for that deal, and Sayo is forced to write it because she's getting killed.
- [x] What about Nanjo's murder which Jessica can hear?
It was whoever EVA Beatrice is, because everybody else has an alibi because of red
- [x] What about the final red?
Sayo is Shannon and Kanon, EVA beatrice is the 17th person
- [x] What about the ending?
Bomb goes boom
- [x] How does Beato swear "...As a good witch, Beatrice swears to continue her studies from this point forth to bring happiness to the people. Will that do?" After all She says in red __I keep my promises__
She secretly wants Battler to win at this point, but she can't let Lambdadelta understand this. So she's trying to not win without letting the game out.
- [x] What is Beato doing in that last scene? Why did she drop the act because she was done?
She secretly wants Battler to win at this point, but she can't let Lambdadelta understand this. So she's trying to not win without letting the game out.
