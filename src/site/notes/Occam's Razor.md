Hound's weapon of choice. It has the power to dissect any narrative down to its  essential elements with chirurgical precision, but it can only carve away, not create, so the wielder is often left without a lot of material.

Of all the possible theories, it cleanly cuts through the ones with weak roots and lets us narrow in on what's easier to make work.
At the same time it reminds us that the author is just one guy who sometimes writes things without considering every possible ramification of that choice.
