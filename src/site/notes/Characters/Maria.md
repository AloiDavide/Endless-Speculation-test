# Descriptions

## Legend
#### Rokkenjima

[[Characters/Rosa\|Rosa]]’s daughter.

Her father’s identity is unknown. She can’t shake off the habit of speaking like a young child, which often earns her a scolding.

She has no interest in studying or making friends, but is very interested in things concerning the occult and black magic. Thanks to her excellent powers of memorization, she knows all kinds of obscure trivia.

---
Missing.

Kihihihihihihihihihi.
## Turn
#### Rokkenjima

[[Characters/Rosa\|Rosa]]’s daughter.

Her father’s identity is unknown. She can’t shake off the habit of speaking like a young child, which often earns her a scolding.

She has no interest in studying or making friends, but is very interested in things concerning the occult and black magic. Thanks to her excellent powers of memorization, she knows all kinds of obscure trivia.

---
Missing.  

In the Golden Land, she learned that her mother still truly loved her.  

At least for now, she is satisfied.
#### Tea Party

 A little magician who has inherited the black blood from [[Characters/Kinzo\|Kinzo]].  

Unlike Kinzo, she was gifted with talent and began to tread the path of the magician from a young age.  
However, her power is still weak, and she hasn’t yet graduated from an apprentice’s level.  

However, she is skilled with enchantments, which bestow magical power upon objects, and the magical items she creates are all master class. 
## Banquet
#### Rokkenjima

[[Characters/Rosa\|Rosa]]’s daughter.

Her father’s identity is unknown. She can’t shake off the habit of speaking like a young child, which often earns her a scolding.

She has no interest in studying or making friends, but is very interested in things concerning the occult and black magic. Thanks to her excellent powers of memorization, she knows all kinds of obscure trivia.

---
Her corpse was found in the [[Mysteries/Rose garden (Banquet)\|rose garden]].  
The cause of her death was strangling, probably by bare hands. Circumstantial evidence makes it reasonable to assume that she was killed after Rosa.  

Then, her blood became the red ink for the witch's oath.
## Alliance

Her corpse was found in the [[Mysteries/Dining hall\|Dining hall]].  
Battler wasn't able to make out any wounds in particular, so he assumed that she was killed by some kind of poison.  

The most peaceful form of invitation to the Golden Land.
#### Future

The [[Speculation/Witch of Origins\|Witch of Origins]], who will live for one thousand years in the future.
She holds the motherly magical power to give birth to 1 from the sea of 0.

At a glance, this magical power is frail.
But no matter how many times you multiply 0, you never end up with anything more than 0. However, the 1 she gave birth to will one day surpass even the heavens.

She is loyally protected by [[Characters/Beatrice\|Beatrice]], who understands her true worth.
The two of them are members of the same alliance.

# Theories
Only parts of her Jaw were found later.
The letter allegedly written by her about Legend is not in her handwriting as seen in the diary.

> [!note]- Magical compendiums are narratives
> [[Tips/Magical Compendiums\|Magical Compendiums]], or systems of magic, are stories or narratives that validate a set of beliefs. They gain more power the more people buy into them but they can also belong to just one person.
> 
> The example given by the author for a [[Tips/Grimoires\|grimoire]], aka a written magic compendium is very clearly the bible, so massive religions and ideologies fit the definition, but so does Maria's coping mechanism to deal with family issues, to name one.
