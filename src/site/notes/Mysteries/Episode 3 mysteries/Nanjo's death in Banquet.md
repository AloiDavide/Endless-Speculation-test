### Axioms
- __After [[Characters/Jessica\|Jessica]] was injured, Eva was constantly under Battler's supervision. [[Characters/Battler\|Battler]] is neither the culprit nor an accomplice. By this, we can establish the perfect alibi for [[Characters/Eva\|Eva]]__.
- __[[Characters/Kinzo\|Kinzo]] is dead__.
- __[[Characters/Krauss\|Krauss]] is dead__.
- __[[Characters/Natsuhi\|Natsuhi]] is dead__.
- __[[Characters/Hideyoshi\|Hideyoshi]] is dead__.
- __[[Characters/George\|George]] is dead__.
- __[[Characters/Rudolf\|Rudolf]] is dead__.
- __[[Characters/Kyrie\|Kyrie]] is dead__.
- __[[Characters/Rosa\|Rosa]] is dead__.
- __[[Characters/Maria\|Maria]] is dead__.
- __[[Characters/Genji\|Genji]] is dead__.
- __[[Characters/Shannon\|Shannon]] is dead__.
- __[[Characters/Kanon\|Kanon]] is dead__.
- __[[Characters/Gohda\|Gohda]] is dead__.
- __[[Characters/Kumasawa\|Kumasawa]] is dead__.
- __[[Characters/Nanjo\|Nanjo]] is dead__.
- __Those 15 are all dead__.
- __[[Characters/Battler\|Battler]] is alive__.
- __[[Characters/Eva\|Eva]] is alive__.
- __[[Characters/Jessica\|Jessica]] is alive__.
- __Eva was with you the whole time. So committing a crime was impossible for her. Of course, Battler-kun isn't the culprit. He wasn't forging an alibi for her, and he took the possibility that she was the culprit into account, watching over her actions carefully. No chance existed for her to do anything suspicious! In short, at the time of the crime, only Nanjo and Jessica were in the servant room__.
- __Ushiromiya Jessica has not committed murder__! __She was not involved with Nanjo's murder__!! __Her eyes were completely covered. It's be impossible for her to carry out a murder like that__!
- __Neither Eva nor battler killed Nanjo, nor were they involved__!!
- __The culprit who killed Nanjo was neither Battler nor Eva nor Jessica__!!
- __Jessica's eyes were completely covered, and murder was impossible for her__!
- __No action caused by jessica's body had any relation to or influence on the Murder of Nanjo__! __This also applies to Battler and Eva__.
- __neither Jessica nor Battler nor Eva is the culprit who killed Nanjo__!
- __Nanjo's death was a homicide__. ...__of course, it was with a direct method of murder, not a trap__. __A weapon was readied, and he was killed with it from point-blank range in front of him! The culprit appeared openly before Nanjo's eyes, and as they both looked at each other's faces, the culprit killed him__...!!
- __The one who killed Nanjo was definitely a human__!
- __A human, with their feet on the ground, held up a weapon and killed with it! Right before his eyes!__

### Corollaries
You just need one person not accounted for by the list to solve this completely, and because Kanon and Shannon are the same person, we are down to 16 humans, one less than the limit of 17.

The official culprit in our theory is [[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]], but it could be [[Characters/X Beatrice\|X Beatrice]] or anybody else.
