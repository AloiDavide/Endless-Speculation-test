This place you stumbled upon is a golden land born from the efforts of Crunter and HoundDogs.
Through our research, our obsession, and of course a fair amount of copium, we have created our own magic compendium by the name of...
<center><h2>Endless Speculation</h2></center>

It's painfully obvious that [[Characters/Battler\|Ushiromiya Battler]] has shown himself to be completely INCOMPETENT and INADEQUATE at his task. This is nothing short of unacceptable, so it now our duty to succeed where he failed.
Armed with our finest weapons: [[Chekhov's Gun\|Chekhov's Gun]] and [[Occam's Razor\|Occam's Razor]]. We shall defeat the [[Characters/Beatrice\|Golden Witch Beatrice]] at her own game and tear apart her narrative.
This golden land is not only our attack on the [[Speculation/Endless Witch\|Endless Witch]], but it will also function as our stronghold going forward.

Behold our vast array of facilities.
- A comprehensive list of every single [[Red Truth\|Red Truth]].
- Long-form theories tackling each of the [[Episodes\|Episodes]] in order.
- Notes for every relevant [[Characters\|Character]] with all of their descriptions in each episode and in each plane of existence, as well as all the theories regarding each of them.
- Notes for all the [[Mysteries/Mysteries\|Mysteries]] we aim to solve and our solutions.
- Transcriptions of the important information found in the extra tips, such as the Epitaph and the monologues.
- Many Blue Truths Hub|blue truths holding a claim and our reasoning for it.
