### Axioms
All the reds are from Evato
- __Kyrie didn't think that they needed food__.
- Since going without food for about a day wouldn't kill them, __she claimed that they should not leave the guesthouse__. And yet, __she herself suggested that they should leave the guesthouse to get food__.
- __the reason she changed her mind was not passed on to anyone, nor was it written down__!
- __Until the last instant before she died, Kyrie's behavior pattern of 'not going to get food = not going to the mansion' was maintained__!
- __Kyrie did not leave anything written down__!

### Corollaries
For once Battler is right. Kyrie simply suspects Hideyoshi and wants to confront him 2 on 1.
It's also a red herring to make you suspicious of Kyrie and Rudolf.
