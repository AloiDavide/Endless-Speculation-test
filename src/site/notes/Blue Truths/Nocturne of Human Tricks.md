A repository of every blue truth aiming to explain the real version of events.

Witches and magic? Something like that can't possibly exist. Every incongruence can definitely be explained with human trick.

> [!note]+ Kinzo was murdered
> Kinzo died before the start of the game, and it's not by old age or illness, but he was attacked and killed.
> We're not saying Krauss did it because he wouldn't have the balls.
> 
> ---
> Leads:
> - It was confirmed that Kinzo is already dead before the game even starts.
> - It can be supposed that this means his death happened the same way in every scenario, but this must mean that every red truth about one of his deaths applies to his one true death.
> - Therefore, looking at the [[Mysteries/6 connected rooms\|6 connected rooms]] case tells us that:
> 	- Kinzo didn't die in a trap.
> 	- Kinzo died instantly after being attacked, suggesting a violent death.
> - His body is consistently (but not always, more on this later) found burned, perhaps as an attempt to hide a different cause of death.

> [!note]+ Sayo gives Maria the letter and Umbrella
> ---
> Leads:
> - This is somebody she could have interacted with repeatedly every time she came to Rokkenjima, enough to create Mariage SorciÃ¨re.
> - If Maria has internalized that this person is Beatrice, there's no longer even a need for the dress disguise.
{ #14ca97}




> [!note]+ Eva and Hideyoshi's closed room was not a closed room
> No closed room existed there, it's just what [[Characters/Kanon\|Kanon]] and [[Characters/Genji\|Genji]] said.
> 
> ---
> Leads:
> - Nowhere does the red explicitly state that this case fits the definition of a [[Mysteries/Beatrice's Definitions#^45ecae\|closed room]].
> - Nor does it negate any method by which the perpetrator could enter the room, it only states that they were murders carried out inside the room.
> - Genji and Kanon claimed that the door was shut and they were forced to break the chain, when they could have just as easily have forced their way in, or persuaded Eva to open the chain.
> - Naturally, the letter was planted by them as well, after all it simply said "Praise my name", they must have been in a hurry with all the relatives waiting for them to return.
{ #152307}


> [!note]+ Kanon and Genji made the magic signs on Eva's door.
> According to the narration, Kanon would have gone to featch a wire cutter with Kumasara, and upon getting back they found a magic circle that wasn't there just a few minutes earlier.
> 
> That is a falsehood.
> 
> ---
> Leads:
> - There is no reason to believe this claim, as the only witnesses to any of it are our prime suspects.
> - Even Kanon having to retrieve a tool to break the chain is something only Kumasawa and Nanjo can confirm. They could have had it with them from the beginning.
{ #997a9a}


> [!note]+ The receipt is not proof against Natsuhi
> Needless to say, Natsuhi wasn't really the last person to see Kinzo before he disappeared, but she had to lie about seeing him because she couldn't let anyone know Kinzo was dead from the start, despite how suspicious it made her look at that moment.
{ #8819e4}


> [!note]+ Kinzo's burned corpse
> Kinzo's body was burned in the incinerator recently.
> 
> ---
> Leads:
> - First things first, because the identity of all unidentified corpses in Legend has been guaranteed in red, that is indeed Kinzo's body.
> - The body couldn't have been burning for longer than several hours or a day at most, or they would have noticed the smell a lot sooner.
> - It's unlikely they left it to rot in the studio it must have been stored somewhere such as a coffin in the chapel.
>- Or maybe it was in the boiler room but it was only incinerated later.

{ #5208d9}



> [!note]+ Krauss burns Kinzo in the boiler room
> It was probably done under orders from Krauss, as an attempt to hide it from all the relatives. 
> He probably didn't think of the smell. He was never the brightest.
> 
> ---
> Leads:
> - Of the people most likely to know about Kinzo's death, he the only one to not feel much affection or respect for the old man.
> - Everyone else would have to obey him as either his employee or overly subservient wife.
> ---
> Obstacles:
> - What reason was there to incinerate the body? Did he think nobody would notice the fingers?
> - The body was never found in [[Turn of the Golden witch\|turn]] and there is no mention of the smell, leading us to believe he wasn't burned in that instance. But why? Was the presence of [[Characters/X Beatrice\|X Beatrice]] a deterrent?
> 	- No it wasn't, after all she is also there in [[Alliance of the Golden witch\|Alliance]].
{ #d6b207}



> [!note]+ The servants burn Kinzo in the boiler room
> The servants are trying to push the narrative of magical murders, so they slowly incinerate Kinzo so that his body will be found with a delay. 
> 
> ---
> Leads:
> - The gross smell is always going to lead to someone discovering the body eventually. Burning the corpse is something you should only do if you plan for it to pop up at some point.
> - Either they move it, or maybe it really was placed there by Krauss to hide it, and all they do is turn on the heat.
> - In Turn, Kinzo was simply never designated as a victim, perhaps due to the interference of [[Characters/X Beatrice\|X Beatrice]] on Sayo's plan.
> ---
> Obstacles:
> - It's hard to believe Genji would do something like that to his former master... unless he believes his new master to be someone with equal or higher authority, someone like Beatrice.
{ #bbf525}


> [!note]+ Maria placed the letter on the table in the study
> The golden witch, that is to say Sayo, gave her the letter and told her to make it look as if the it appeared out of thin air. So that is exactly what she did. 
> 
> ---
> Leads:
> - Maria is the first to point out the letter while everyone else was focused on something else.
> - She clearly enjoys spooking people who don't believe in witches.
> - She thinks Beatrice can't get inside because of the scorpion charm, so the task is up to her.
> - Alternatively it could have been one of Genji, Nanjo or Kumasawa, but the naive placement points us more toward Maria.

> [!note]+ The servants were betrayed in the parlor
> Sayo couldn't get into the study because it was locked, so she had to turn on her allies as a means to reach her goal... no, as a goal to reach her means.
> 
> After killing them she started the phone call, left the room, and locked it the same way she opened it. With a master key.
> 
> ---
> Leads:
> - Gengi, Kumasawa and Nanjo had accepted their exile from the study without much of a fuss. They didn't think they were in much danger.
> - The parlor was supposedly locked too, but the culprit would have had a master key, and it's possible the three let the intruder in willingly thinking it was an ally.
> - Without any red truth regarding the master keys, this is not a closed room at all.
{ #d8833b}


> [!note]+ Genji, Kumasawa, and Nanjo are not killers
> - Nanjo wasn't directly involved in any killing, all he did was lie.
> - Kumasawa likewise didn't kill anybody herself, she would have been overpowered. Even if we suppose she attacked Kanon, he didn't die.
> - This is a problem for Genji, but maybe one person is enough to carry out the murders and he just watches?
> 
> Alternatively this red isn't so broad and it only refers to that scene in the parlor.
{ #c7b26a}



> [!note]+ The letter Natsuhi found in the parlor was a threat
> 
> 
> ---
> Leads:
> - The only reason she would leave without telling anybody is that she was forced to.
> ---
> Obstacles:
> - The culprit couldn't guarantee who would read the letter, so it can't be something aimed at Natsuhi specifically.
{ #7c6464}


> [!note]+ Natsuhi's death in Legend
> She was shot by Sayo, who is still alive unbeknownst to us.
> 
> ---
> Leads:
> - There is a contradiction between the first red and the final one (thanks Lambdadelta), so we are forced to restrict the first to include among the survivors only the people we are aware of at that moment, not any other potential  alive person on the island.
> - We know from later episodes that there are multiple winchesters.
{ #aa6a42}


> [!failure]+ Natsuhi gets replaced in Legend
> Natsuhi was shot at some point previously, maybe during the murder of the first twilight, and from that point forward somebody else impersonates her. At the end her actual corpse is taken out
> 
> ---
> Leads:
> - It explains why she would run away from the parlor.
> - It solves the red with no extra people at the end.
> 
> ---
> Obstacles:
> - We ran out of possible candidates.
> - If our culprit X is Natsuhi who is always with battler at the end, who's killing people?
> - Convincingly passing as somebody else is quite hard when you think about it, you would need a lot of practice.
{ #af3bfa}



> [!note]+ Kanon did not die... at all!
> Why assume he died when they could just as easily have faked it.
> 
> ---
> Leads:
> - Kanon supposedly pulls out the stake from his chest before being found.
> - They had plenty of fake blood to make the magic circles.
> - Beatrice refuses to repeat that it was a homicide.
> - We already think Nanjo is lying.
> - We couldn't figure out another way around the red.
> ---
> Obstacles:
> - Jessica supposedly witnessed his death because she was taking care of him the whole time, but she also would have believed the doctor in the room when he declares someone dead.
{ #ab1ae9}


> [!note]+ Shannon isn't dead
> The supposed corpse of Shannon isn't hers and it also isn't a corpse. That is simply [[Characters/X Beatrice\|X Beatrice]] trying to hide herself with the help of the adults.
> 
> ---
> Leads:
> -  We can beat the red by simply claiming that the person there wasn't dead and thus not an unidentified corpse.
> - Maybe after seeing the spitting image of Beatrice the Ushiromiya parents want to keep it a secret.
> ---
> Obstacles:
> - Does the motive make any sense with the whole murder going on? Would this be the priority of a bunch of greedy but otherwise innocent people? And are the kids really the ones to whom this secret needs to be kept?
> - We would rather X Beatrice not be in Legend because it breaks another theory.
{ #e42bf6}



> [!note]+ The epitaph isn't a scam
> Actually solving the epitaph will give you some reward.
> 
> ---
> Leads:
> - According to Beatrice, just after she says **I keep my promises**, by solving the Riddle of the Epitaph you should be able to reach the [[Golden Land\|Golden Land]]
{ #86493e}




> [!note]+ The epitaph leads you to the portrait
> The epitaph points to a secret passage one can find by examining the portrait of Beatrice the right way.
> 
> ---
> Leads:
> - The solution to the epitaph is supposedly a fairly dumb pun according to meta Evato.
> - Sweetfish river is potentially referring to the the family tree.
> - Bank = Kishi(å²¸) = Kishi(è²´å§) = Old japanese way of referring with respect so someone's elder sister.
> - The oldest sister is Eva(çµµç¾½)
> 	- çµµ = picture / drawing / painting 
> 	- ç¾½ = feather / wing
> - Maybe the section of the painting with the wing effigy hides a key or some kind of mechanism.
