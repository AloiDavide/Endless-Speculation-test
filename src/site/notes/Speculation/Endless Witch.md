>The title of [[Speculation/Endless Witch\|Endless Witch]] has its fundation in "Endless Creation" and is the root of her
> unmatched, eldless magical power.
> ~ [[Tips/Beatrice's Titles\|Beatrice's Titles]]

>When she was joined with the [[Speculation/Witch of Origins\|Witch of Origins]] through [[Tips/Mariage Sorcière\|Mariage Sorcière]], their [[Tips/Magical Compendiums\|magical compendium]] gained an endless span, as well as endless power.
>~ [[Characters/Beatrice#Alliance\|Beatrice#Alliance]]

>It's probably safe to say that the formation of this alliance allowed Beatrice to gain the endless power in its truest sense.

> [!note]- Endless magic is a folk tale
> The origin of the [[Speculation/Endless Witch\|endless magic]] narrative is a kind of folklore passed down in [[Characters/Kumasawa\|Kumasawa]]'s family. It pre-dates [[Characters/Kinzo\|Kinzo]]'s golden witch narrative and it could have been a source of inspiration for him, or maybe the two concepts were separate until they were merged by [[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]], who was raised in part by both of them.

> Maria has contributed her imagination and occult hyper fixation, but she didn't come up with the whole thing like we initially theorized. Maybe "gaining endless power" means entering the public consciousness, and the rokkenjima case was instrumental for that to happen with [[Characters/Beatrice\|Beatrice]].

> - The magical lore fluff in [[Tips/Regarding the Succession of Witches\|Regarding the Succession of Witches]] hints at a long lineage of endless witches, but nothing of the sort exists about the golden witch.
> - [[Characters/Virgilia\|Virgilia]], aka. [[Characters/Kumasawa\|Kumasawa]] is the previous endless witch, but seemingly not a golden witch.
