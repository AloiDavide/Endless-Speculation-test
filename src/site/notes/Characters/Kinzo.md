# Descriptions

## Legend
#### Rokkenjima

The aged head of the Ushiromiya family.

Even though it has already been announced that he has just a few months to live, he is brimming with energy. Though he amassed a vast fortune in the past, he never made any announcements regarding the inheritance, which worries his children.

He is strongly influenced by the West and is a rabid fan of the occult.
His study is packed with mysterious grimoires.

---
Disappeared from his study unnoticed.
Kinzo’s study has everything from a bed to a toilet to a bathtub, so it is extremely rare for him to go outside.

However, he does occasionally go out for a walk on a whim without telling anybody, and his disappearance invariably leads to a huge uproar throughout the house. He usually comes back as soon as he gets hungry... usually...

---
Burned in the incinerator, with a weapon resembling an [[Characters/The Seven Stakes of Purgatory\|icepick]] sticking out of his forehead.

The old sorcerer’s wish vanished before it could be granted. He always knew that this was one possible result of his risky gamble.

## Turn
#### Rokkenjima

The aged head of the [[Ushiromiya\|Ushiromiya]] family.

Even though it has already been announced that he has just a few months to live, he is brimming with energy. Though he amassed a vast fortune in the past, he never made any announcements regarding the inheritance, which worries his children.

He is strongly influenced by the West and is a rabid fan of the occult.
His study is packed with mysterious grimoires.

---
He finally reached the Golden Land he so desired to see.  
However, since a fool was unwilling to accept it, the magic was wasted once again.  

Even so, he was probably happy. After all, he managed to be reunited with the [[Speculation/Golden Witch\|Golden Witch]], if only for a brief time.  

Afterwards, he was crushed to bits and eaten by demons and went to hell.

#### Tea Party


A self-taught human sorcerer.  
His natural talent and level of knowledge are nothing special, but when his nearly insane powers of concentration and dedication were transformed into magical power, he awakened as a great sorcerer.  

His power is at least great enough that he was able to summon [[Characters/Beatrice\|Beatrice]] and form a contract with her.  

Though his power is great, it is also extremely limited. He specializes in summoning and barriers, so perhaps it is fitting to call him a summoner.
## Banquet
#### Rokkenjima

The aged head of the Ushiromiya family.

Even though it has already been announced that he has just a few months to live, he is brimming with energy. Though he amassed a vast fortune in the past, he never made any announcements regarding the inheritance, which worries his children.

He is strongly influenced by the West and is a rabid fan of the occult.
His study is packed with mysterious grimoires.

---
His body was found as a burnt corpse in the underground boiler room's incinerator.  

No evidence of a struggle was found inside the incinerator, so it's probably reasonable to assume that he was burned after his murder.  

Too bad this time.  
It was game over right from the start.
## Alliance

Dust to dust. Ashes to ashes. The dead to the dead.

#### Tea Party


Goldsmith is Kinzo's sorcerer's name. His skill as a summoner is legendary for the current era. His summoning ability surpasses even [[Characters/Beatrice\|Beatrice]]'s at times.

However, he is very mismatched, excelling in some areas while fatally lacking as a sorcerer in others.

Magic with enough power to reheat a cup of black tea may be beyond him, but he's capable of summoning demons with magic strong enough to boil the sea.

The source of his magic is found in arithmetic miracles, and his [[Tips/Magical Compendiums\|magical compendium]] is unique. Later on, even Beatrice took note of this and rearranged her own compendium accordingly.

# Theories
Kinzo has very high magic resistance and is unable to see Beatrice's witch form in the magical interpretation. Are they trying to tell us what he feels for her isn't love?

> [!note]- Kinzo's magical compendium
> It's based on arithmetic miracles, his idea of magic involves taking huge risks for huge rewards. This is probably related to how he became the head of the family apparently by dumb luck, and how he bluffed his way to becoming a millionare by making crazy investments, almost as if he had 10 tons of gold lying around.... Not that the gold ever existed though.

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



> [!note]+ The Golden Witch is Kinzo's version of Beatrice
> This is the [[Characters/Beatrice\|Beatrice]] made up by [[Characters/Kinzo\|Kinzo]] to convince everyone that he possessed 10 tons of gold. Even to this day the modern incarnation of beatrice is supporting this claim and identifying with the image and narrative Kinzo has created because it's a valuable addition to her own narrative ([[Speculation/Endless Realization\|Endless Realization]]).

> Leads:
> - It's the title inherited by solving [[Tips/The Portrait Epitaph\|The Portrait Epitaph]]. 
> - The description of golden magic from [[Tips/Beatrice's Titles\|Beatrice's Titles]] literally says it can "materialize imaginary precious metals".

> [!tip]- Kinzo summoning Beatrice
> Kinzo's specialty is summoning, he absolutely sucks at everything else. 
> As said in [[Tips/Letter from a Summoner\|Letter from a Summoner]], it's a type of magic that requires a vessel, as well as a huge amount of preparation in order to manifest a miracle permanently.
> 
> It's possible Kinzo's idea of summoning beatrice was to spend a very long time, decades perhaps, to raise a person in isolation and mold her into his ideal of the witch. That unfortunate person would have been [[Characters/0 Beatrice\|0 Beatrice]].
> 
> The vessel idea is also interesting considering he probably was the first to come up with the whole furniture thing.

> [!note]- Kinzo was murdered
> Kinzo died before the start of the game, and it's not by old age or illness, but he was attacked and killed.
> We're not saying Krauss did it because he wouldn't have the balls.
> 
> ---
> Leads:
> - It was confirmed that Kinzo is already dead before the game even starts.
> - It can be supposed that this means his death happened the same way in every scenario, but this must mean that every red truth about one of his deaths applies to his one true death.
> - Therefore, looking at the [[Mysteries/6 connected rooms\|6 connected rooms]] case tells us that:
> 	- Kinzo didn't die in a trap.
> 	- Kinzo died instantly after being attacked, suggesting a violent death.
> - His body is consistently (but not always, more on this later) found burned, perhaps as an attempt to hide a different cause of death.

> [!note]- The Kinzo damage control squad
> It would be fair to say that only people who are aware of Kinzo's death are allowed to have fake scenes where they meet him.
> 
> The people in the know would have to include, at a minimum:
> - Krauss, who is trying to hide the fact from his siblings.
> - Natsuhi, who has no choice other than following Krauss.
> - Nanjo, the physician who regularly took care of him.
> - Genji, who frequently keeps him company.
> - Kanon and Shannon, who are shown serving him his meals inside the study.
>

> - Kumasawa is left out the tally because there's no proof akin to the interactions he has with the other servants, but it's possible she knows.
> - As for Jessica she wouldn't interact with Kinzo anyway.
> - Gohda is jut the cook, no reason to tell him.

> Everybody else only comes to the island once every year.

#### Kinzo's corpse

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



> [!note]- Kinzo's burned corpse
> Kinzo's body was burned in the incinerator recently.
> 
> ---
> Leads:
> - First things first, because the identity of all unidentified corpses in Legend has been guaranteed in red, that is indeed Kinzo's body.
> - The body couldn't have been burning for longer than several hours or a day at most, or they would have noticed the smell a lot sooner.
> - It's unlikely they left it to rot in the studio it must have been stored somewhere such as a coffin in the chapel.
>- Or maybe it was in the boiler room but it was only incinerated later.

</div></div>


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



> [!tip]- Krauss burns Kinzo in the boiler room
> It was probably done under orders from Krauss, as an attempt to hide it from all the relatives. 
> He probably didn't think of the smell. He was never the brightest.
> 
> ---
> Leads:
> - Of the people most likely to know about Kinzo's death, he the only one to not feel much affection or respect for the old man.
> - Everyone else would have to obey him as either his employee or overly subservient wife.
> ---
> Obstacles:
> - What reason was there to incinerate the body? Did he think nobody would notice the fingers?
> - The body was never found in [[Episodes/Turn of the Golden witch\|turn]] and there is no mention of the smell, leading us to believe he wasn't burned in that instance. But why? Was the presence of [[Characters/X Beatrice\|X Beatrice]] a deterrent?
> 	- No it wasn't, after all she is also there in [[Episodes/Alliance of the Golden witch\|Alliance]].

</div></div>


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



> [!note]- The servants burn Kinzo in the boiler room
> The servants are trying to push the narrative of magical murders, so they slowly incinerate Kinzo so that his body will be found with a delay. 
> 
> ---
> Leads:
> - The gross smell is always going to lead to someone discovering the body eventually. Burning the corpse is something you should only do if you plan for it to pop up at some point.
> - Either they move it, or maybe it really was placed there by Krauss to hide it, and all they do is turn on the heat.
> - In Turn, Kinzo was simply never designated as a victim, perhaps due to  \[REDACTED\].
> ---
> Obstacles:
> - It's hard to believe Genji would do something like that to his former master... unless he believes his new master to be someone with equal or higher authority, someone like Beatrice.
