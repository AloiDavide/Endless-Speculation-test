# Theories

Formerly known as student Beato (by us, who gaslit ourselves, into thinking that was a student costume or somethign and then were not able to stop calling her that) 

She is the 19th person X on Rokkenjima, at least in turn and alliance.

> The supposed corpse of Shannon isn't hers and it also isn't a corpse. That is simply [[Characters/X Beatrice\|X Beatrice]] trying to hide herself with the help of the adults.

> Leads:
> -  We can beat the red by simply claiming that the person there wasn't dead and thus not an unidentified corpse.

> - Her presence isn't required for any Legend solution, and her being here would break an interesting pattern with the episodes.

Fose Kinzo ha fatto un will per X ma lei si vuole uccidere quindi finanzia Sayo??
Sayo e X hanno ottenuto 2 miliardi di yen 

X NON é beatrice perchè il peccato non è nei confronti di beatrice in rosso.

X ha un nome proprio diverso da Beatrice e 6 anni fa non si identificava come tale, perchè:
__Six years ago, no person called [[Characters/Beatrice\|Beatrice]] existed for me.__
__The sin I am now demanding that you remember is not between Ushiromiya Battler and Beatrice.
