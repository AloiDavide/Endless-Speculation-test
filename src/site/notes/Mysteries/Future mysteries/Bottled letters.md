In the future where half of Alliance takes place, accounts of at least the first three games have been recovered inside different bottles in the sea near Rokkenjima.

The legend letter has been signed with Maria's name, but it's not her handwriting, it's the handwriting of the person who Maria knew as Beatrice. Ange was able to know this because of a passage she wrote in Maria's diary.

Hilariously, when compared to Higurashi the game Beatrice plays against Bernkaster is almost literally 4D chess. You have multiple chessboards stacked on top of each other and then you  have pieces like Ange moving along the time axis.

## Theories


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



> [!note]- Rokkenjima is in a superposition because of the letters
> Nobody really knows what happened there, all we have are the [[Mysteries/Future mysteries/Bottled letters\|Bottled letters]] all giving a different account of the events, and the four episodes we see are four of such letters, out of an unknown amount. 
> 
> From a magical point of view, it's this uncertainty that allows the entire island to cycle through endless possibilities and be regularly populated by witches and demons. A perfect schrodinger's box.

Ok, but then what ACTUALLY happened on Rokkenjima in reality?
Two theories:


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



> [!note]- Legend is the "canonical" version of the events.
> We were asked on more than one occasion which episode we expected to be the "real" one.
> We don't know how many if any more games will happen in the answer arcs, so we choose Legend as the most likely candidate from the question arcs.
>  
> ---
> Leads:
> - The first tea party is a direct continuation of Legend, and every following interaction between Battler and Beatrice is framed as a continuation of that one. A discrepancy in the [[Speculation/Character Description Colors\|character description colors]] further supports this reading.
> - Beatrice, Shannon and Kanon claim to have seen countless loops already, but this is merely the same magic fluff as the witch killing and reviving someone 100 times.
> - It's not really a question you would ask unless you knew there is an answer.

> [!note]- The "canonical" version of the events will be the one where Battler wins the game.
> We just haven't seen it yet, because the mystery hasn't been solved.

> ---
> Leads:
> - If the truth about what transpired on Rokkenjima were to be revealed, that means Battler will have won and the black box will be broken.
> - The framing of the [[Mysteries/Future mysteries/Bottled letters\|Bottled letters]] would suggest that Legend is yet another letter, but who says that any of them recount the real story?
