# Descriptions

## Banquet
#### Tea Party

Solved the riddle of [[Tips/The Portrait Epitaph\|the witch's epitaph]] and was welcomed as the new [[Speculation/Endless Witch\|Endless Witch]].
She was gifted with an aptitude for magic and is expected to grow into an extraordinary Great Witch.

This genius of a witch often overindulged in her own power during her younger days.
Such are the trials only geniuses may endure, and if she proves successful, her name will surely be engraved in the history of Endless Witches.

Will she be able to overcome the trials that forced her predecessor to surrender?

> [!note]- REDACTED THEORY
> This blue truth has been hidden with magic for the purpose of not spoiling future long form theories, please come back later.

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



> [!tip]- Evato is not Eva
> She looks like Eva but is not her, not in the same way that MARIA is Maria  or ANGE is Ange.
> 
> ---
> Leads:
> - Eva was confirmed to be somewhere else entirely when she was committing the last murders.
> - In the meta battle at the end of Banquet, she backs down from claiming she is Eva to instead claiming she isn't human at all.
> - Ange later hints at not taking appearances for granted.

> [!tip]- Kasumi Sumadera is EVA Beatrice.
> If we absolutely must find her an identity among the known characters, it would have to be [[Characters/Kasumi\|Kasumi]].

> Leads:
> - > "Will she be able to overcome the trials that forced her predecessor to surrender?"
> 	- Kyrie could be said to have surrendered when faced with her family's trials.
> - She literally shows up layered over Kasumi  to represent the [[Speculation/Black Magic\|Black Witch]].
> - There was a big deal in Banquet about the cigarette Kyrie had in her pocket that didn't actually lead anywhere, and later on Kasumi is confirmed to be a smoker.
> 
> Cons:
> - It disqualifies her from being the future Eva we need for our [[Characters/Eva#Theories\|Eva#Theories]].
> - The black witch framework is applied to Rosa and Maria as well.
