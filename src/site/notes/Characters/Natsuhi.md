# Descriptions

## Legend
#### Rokkenjima

[[Characters/Krauss\|Krauss]]’s wife.

She manages the household of the Ushiromiya head family in place of her husband, who takes little interest in such matters. She was in charge of all preparations and arrangements for this family conference.

She possesses a strong sense of responsibility and a great deal of pride.
However, neither her husband nor his siblings understand her very well, so her position is far from enviable.

---
Found shot to death in front of the [[Mysteries/Episode 1 mysteries/Natsuhi's death in Legend\|portrait room]].

How impudent of her to challenge a witch with nothing but a mere [[Tips/Winchester M1984 Sawed off\|gun]]. Of course, she’d end up like this. Kihihihihihihihihi.
## Turn
#### Rokkenjima

[[Characters/Krauss\|Krauss]]’s wife.

She manages the household of the Ushiromiya head family in place of her husband, who takes little interest in such matters. She was in charge of all preparations and arrangements for this family conference.

She possesses a strong sense of responsibility and a great deal of pride.
However, neither her husband nor his siblings understand her very well, so her position is far from enviable.

---
Her corpse was found in the [[Mysteries/Crime scene of the Chapel\|Chapel]].  
The direct cause of death is unknown, but it seems her stomach was cut open and her intestines pulled out after her death.  
On top of that, sweets and candies were packed into her stomach.  

Didn't I tell you? Stomachs are packed full of candy.
## Banquet
#### Rokkenjima

[[Characters/Krauss\|Krauss]]’s wife.

She manages the household of the Ushiromiya head family in place of her husband, who takes little interest in such matters. She was in charge of all preparations and arrangements for this family conference.

She possesses a strong sense of responsibility and a great deal of pride.
However, neither her husband nor his siblings understand her very well, so her position is far from enviable.

---
Her corpse was found in the rose garden arbor.
The cause of her death is assumed to be strangling with a rope-like object. A [[Characters/The Seven Stakes of Purgatory\|stake-shaped weapon]] was sticking out of her calf.  

Why do I even have to follow the epitaph in the first place? Is this some kind of game?
## Alliance
#### Rokkenjima

[[Characters/Krauss\|Krauss]]’s wife.

She manages the household of the Ushiromiya head family in place of her husband, who takes little interest in such matters. She was in charge of all preparations and arrangements for this family conference.

She possesses a strong sense of responsibility and a great deal of pride.
However, neither her husband nor his siblings understand her very well, so her position is far from enviable.

---
Her corpse was found in the [[Mysteries/Dining hall\|Dining hall]].  
About half of her head was destroyed. It's probably reasonable to assume that she was murdered with a [[Characters/The Chiester Sisters Imperial Guard Corps\|powerful gun]] or something similar.  

However, the witnesses don’t believe she was killed with a gun...
# Theories


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



> [!note]- Natsuhi's death in Legend
> She was shot by [[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]], who is still alive unbeknownst to us. Both the Shannon and Kanon deaths were faked using tricks that don't involve the use of unidentified corpses.
> 
> ---
> Leads:
> - The reds seemingly contradict each other, especially after we learn the culprit was present in the same room (thanks [[Characters/Lambdadelta\|Lambdadelta]]!), so something has to give, and  __There were no unidentified corpses, and all of the survivors have alibis!__ is the only part with some wiggle room.
> -  We are forced to restrict the definition of survivors to include only the people we are aware of at that moment, and not any other potentially alive person on the island. 
> - The unidentifies corpses part only rules out some tricks, but it's still possible to lie about someone's death without showing the corpse.
> - We know from later episodes that there are multiple winchesters.

> [!note]- The receipt is not proof against Natsuhi
> Needless to say, Natsuhi wasn't really the last person to see Kinzo before he disappeared, but she had to lie about seeing him because she couldn't let anyone know Kinzo was dead from the start, despite how suspicious it made her look at that moment.

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



> [!note]- The Kinzo damage control squad
> It would be fair to say that only people who are aware of Kinzo's death are allowed to have fake scenes where they meet him.

> The people in the know would have to include, at a minimum:
> - Krauss, who is trying to hide the fact from his siblings.
> - Natsuhi, who has no choice other than following Krauss.
> - Nanjo, the physician who regularly took care of him.
> - Genji, who frequently keeps him company.
> - Kanon and Shannon, who are shown serving him his meals inside the study.

> - Kumasawa is left out the tally because there's no proof akin to the interactions he has with the other servants, but it's possible she knows.
> - As for Jessica she wouldn't interact with Kinzo anyway.
> - Gohda is jut the cook, no reason to tell him.
> 
> Everybody else only comes to the island once every year.

> Obstacles:
> - The culprit couldn't guarantee who would read the letter, so it can't be something aimed at Natsuhi specifically.
