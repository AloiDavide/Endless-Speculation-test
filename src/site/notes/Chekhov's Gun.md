Crunter's weapon of choice. It can shoot an unseen target without fail from any distance, however it cannot guarantee the existence of the target, so its wielder is bound to fire empty shots from time to time.

It lets us make claims that can't be directly deduced, but would be narratively satisfying if true. After all, if it's foreshadowed it has to happen eventually.
