This place you found your way in is our very own golden land.
Each armed with our weapon of choice: Chekov's gun and Occam's razor. We shall succeed at defeating the Golden Witch Beatrice at her own game and tear apart her narrative.

This is our magic compendium
##### Endless Speculation

We got ourselves:
- A comprehensive list of every single [[Red Truth\|Red Truth]].
- Notes for each [[Characters\|character]] with all of their descriptions in each episode and in each plane of existence.
- Transcriptions of other important information like the tips, the extras and the [[The Portrait Epitaph\|epitaph]].
- An inventory of all the most relevant mysteries for each [[Episodes\|episode]].
- Many blue truths, each containing one claim and our reasoning for it.




SCIENCE compels us to TEST THE LIMITS of the narrative of the [[Characters/Beatrice\|GOLDEN WITCH BEATRICE]].

[[Characters/Battler\|Ushiromiya Battler]] has revealed himself to be COMPLETELLY INCOMPETENT and INADEQUATE TO THE TASK of DEFEATING THE GOLDEN WITCH BEATRICE at her own game. This is NOTHING SHORT OF UNACCEPTABLE! We are going to create a theory UNDEFEATABLE to slay the GOLDEN WITCH and defeat her narrative. We will SUCCEED where Icarus has FAILED.
