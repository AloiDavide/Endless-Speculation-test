As we know, the character descriptions in the pause menu are divided in three areas.
Each character sprite always has behind it the same flower pattern, but the color changes based on the side we're on.

- Rokkenjima, or the "human side"  has a bright red pattern.

- The tea party, or "witch side" is bright yellow.

- The future, or "Ange side", only added in [[Episodes/Alliance of the Golden witch\|Alliance]], is white.

An exception to this rule are the [[Legend of the Golden witch\|Legend of the Golden witch]] descriptions. It lacks witch descriptions because they aren't featured in the story until the end, and instead of the red pattern we would expect, we see a golden yellow pattern, as if the world of legend is more closely tied to the tea party than it is to all subsequent games.
