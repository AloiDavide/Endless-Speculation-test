# Descriptions

## Legend
### Rokkemjima

The son of [[Characters/Rudolf\|Rudolf]] and his first wife, [[Characters/Ushiromiya Asumu\|Ushiromiya Asumu]].

When his father married a second wife shortly after Asumu’s death, Battler rebelled and went to live with his grandparents on his mother’s side. However, both of these grandparents passed away, and he has now returned to the Ushiromiya family after six years.

This family conference is a chance for him to renew his friendship with his cousins after a six-year gap.

This fool made the world where everyone could be happy all come to nothing.

Though [[Characters/Beatrice\|Beatrice]] is extremely angry, she also seems to be enjoying herself immensely. It’s almost as though she’s waited a thousand years to get her hands on a toy as fun as this one.

Hopefully, even this fool will be able to see you before too long...

Missing.  

He did surrender to the witch at one point, but he pulled himself together and regained his will to fight.  

I see... So, to witches, Battler makes a great toy for smashing.  
That explains why she's always breaking him, fixing him, and breaking him again.  

Torture is meaningless if you kill the subject.  
You've gotta alternate between causing pain and letting them rest.
#### Tea Party

An unfortunate young man whom Beatrice has taken a liking to.  
A human who inherited the black blood from [[Characters/Kinzo\|Kinzo]].  

The massive resistance to magical power Kinzo was born with was passed on to Battler. Ironically, it was this trait that made it so hard for Kinzo to succeed as a magician.  

A massive defensive power against magic can be, even by itself, decisive in a battle against a witch.  

Kinzo has begun to lose this power with age, but young Battler’s power is still on the rise.  

Perhaps it’s understandable that Beatrice tried to crush it as soon as possible.
## Banquet

Shot to death by Ushiromiya [[Characters/Eva\|Eva]] inside the mansion.  

The weapon was a [[Tips/Winchester M1984 Sawed off\|Winchester]] from [[Characters/Kinzo\|Kinzo]]'s collection.  

[[Characters/Jessica\|Jessica]] had lost her eyesight. Alone with Battler.  

Wolves and sheep puzzle.

Missing.  

Went to hell embraced by the witch.  
But to the witch, that hell was the [[Speculation/Golden Land\|Golden Land]].
# Theories



### Battler's sin
X beato is more personally wounded, sayo enacts revenge for her sister?

> [!note]+ Hypothesis
> Is Battler's sin from 6 years ago about him destroying someone's Golden Land like Ange did with Maria as a child?
> 
> 
> ---
> Leads:
> - "This fool made the world where everyone could be happy all come to nothing"
> - Battler is consistently ruining Beatrice's golden land in the magical narrative.

>[!note]+ Hypothesis
> Is it X Beato? Did she have a cope world of her own that Battler broke?
> 
> ---
> Leads:
> - She is the one with regrets about it and looks hurt after he doesn't remember.
> - Crunter said so and that's the best answer we got.

### Battler's identity
- (Battler) __My name is Ushiromiya Battler__.
- (Beato) __I am the golden witch Beatrice. And I opened this game in order to fight Ushiromiya Kinzo's grandchild, Ushiromiya Battler.__
- (Battler) __Ushiromiya Battler's mother is Ushiromiya Asumu.__
- (Battler) __My name is Ushiromiya Battler__
- (Battler) __It was from Ushiromiya [[Characters/Ushiromiya Asumu\|Asumu]] that Ushiromiya Battler is born.__
- Battler tries to repeat "It was from Ushiromiya Asumu that I was born" but he can only say __It was from Ushiromiya__......nghu, ......?!
- __You are not Ushiromiya Asumu's son__.

> [!note]+ Deduction
> Battler is the son of [[Characters/Kyrie\|Kyrie]] and [[Characters/Rudolf\|Rudolf]]. He and [[Characters/Ushiromiya Asumu\|Ushiromiya Asumu]]'s stillborn son had their identities switched by somebody, possibly Rudolf in order to justify his choice of wife.
>
> Evidence:
> - This scene of Kyrie fighting Mammon.
