# Descriptions

## Legend
#### Rokkenjima

[[Characters/Kinzo\|Kinzo]]’s second child.

She is hostile towards her brother [[Characters/Krauss\|Krauss]] and opposes him whenever she can, from issues dealing with the family fortune to the question of who will succeed the family headship.

Normally, she would have lost her place in the Ushiromiya family register upon her marriage, but she managed to forcibly overcome this by having her husband take her family name.

---
Found on the bed of a [[Mysteries/Episode 1 mysteries/Eva and Hideyoshi's room\|guest room]] inside the mansion, with a weapon resembling an [[Characters/The Seven Stakes of Purgatory\|icepick]] sticking out of her forehead.
## Turn
#### Rokkenjima

[[Characters/Kinzo\|Kinzo]]’s second child.

She is hostile towards her brother [[Characters/Krauss\|Krauss]] and opposes him whenever she can, from issues dealing with the family fortune to the question of who will succeed the family headship.

Normally, she would have lost her place in the Ushiromiya family register upon her marriage, but she managed to forcibly overcome this by having her husband take her family name.

---
Her corpse was found in the [[Mysteries/Episode 2 mysteries/Crime scene in the chapel\|Chapel]].  
The direct cause of death is unknown, but it seems her stomach was cut open and her intestines pulled out after her death.  
On top of that, sweets and candies were packed into her stomach.  

Everyone has a stomach filled with sweet dreams.
## Banquet
#### Rokkenjima

[[Characters/Kinzo\|Kinzo]]’s second child.

She is hostile towards her brother [[Characters/Krauss\|Krauss]] and opposes him whenever she can, from issues dealing with the family fortune to the question of who will succeed the family headship.

Normally, she would have lost her place in the Ushiromiya family register upon her marriage, but she managed to forcibly overcome this by having her husband take her family name.
## Alliance
#### Rokkenjima

[[Characters/Kinzo\|Kinzo]]’s second child.

She is hostile towards her brother [[Characters/Krauss\|Krauss]] and opposes him whenever she can, from issues dealing with the family fortune to the question of who will succeed the family headship.

Normally, she would have lost her place in the Ushiromiya family register upon her marriage, but she managed to forcibly overcome this by having her husband take her family name.

---
Her corpse was found in the [[Mysteries/Dining hall\|Dining hall]].  
About half of her head was destroyed. It’s probably reasonable to assume that she was murdered with a [[powerful gun\|powerful gun]] or something similar.  

However, the witnesses don’t believe she was killed with a gun...
#### Future

After being repeatedly hospitalized because of psychogenic stress, she has already died in the world of 1998 due to acute heart failure.

She lived her later years in isolation, with no one to understand her, and is the only survivor from [[Rokkenjima\|Rokkenjima]]. The media gave her the name “Queen of Suspicion”.

She continued to make reckless expansions of her business just like [[Characters/Kinzo\|Kinzo]] had done in the past, which earned her many enemies.

By her later years, she was doing it merely to harass people, as if she enjoyed it, rather than for financial gain.

And it was all done for the sake of [[Characters/Ange\|Ange]], who would eventually succeed her.
# Theories


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



> [!note]- Eva didn't come back from Rokkenjima
> The [[Characters/Eva\|Ushiromiya Eva]] in [[Characters/Ange\|Ange]]'s future is someone else claiming to be her, she was brought to Kuwadorian after the two days to be found by the police as a plan to take control of the Ushiromiya group.
> 
> Leads:
> - Eva was present in Rokkenjima based on several red truths, but if **No one escapes, all die** is a general statement like we suspect, then even in Banquet where her fate is unknown, Eva didn't get out of Rokkenjima.
> - The witch hunters finding accounts of multiple episodes in the [[Mysteries/Future mysteries/Bottled letters\|Bottled letters]] implies that the future is fixed just like the past, so no matter what really happened on Rokkenjima Ange will see an aunt Eva come back.
> - Eva both does and doesn't come back every time, so there must be two Evas.
> - She never spoke about what happened on the island because she wasn't there and didn't know.
> 
> Obstacles:
> - A series of assumptions go into this theory. That red could apply only to alliance and there could be multiple futures.
> - Out of the known characters there is no working candidate for the fake Eva.

> [!note]- Eva made the scratches on Natsuhi's door
> [[Characters/Eva\|Eva]] was in on [[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]]'s plan, she knew there would be murders and she wanted to avoid being suspected by the police, so she took some of the fake blood and made the marks on the doorknob with the scoprion charm hanging from it.

> [!note]- Eva and Hideyoshi's closed room was not a closed room
> No closed room existed there, it's just what [[Characters/Kanon\|Kanon]] and [[Characters/Genji\|Genji]] said.
> 
> ---
> Leads:
> - Nowhere does the red explicitly state that this case fits the definition of a [[Speculation/Beatrice's Definitions#^45ecae\|closed room]].
> - Nor does it negate any method by which the perpetrator could enter the room, it only states that they were murders carried out inside the room.
> - Genji and Kanon claimed that the door was shut and they were forced to break the chain, but nobody saw the chain before it was broken. They either used the wire cutters to break in or they persuaded Eva who was their ally to open the chain, and later broke it from the inside.
> - Naturally, the letter was planted by them as well, after all it simply said "Praise my name", they must have been in a hurry with all the relatives waiting for them to return.
