# Descriptions

## Banquet
#### Tea Party

Solved the riddle of [[Tips/The Portrait Epitaph\|the witch's epitaph]] and was welcomed as the new [[Speculation/Endless Witch\|Endless Witch]].
She was gifted with an aptitude for magic and is expected to grow into an extraordinary Great Witch.

This genius of a witch often overindulged in her own power during her younger days.
Such are the trials only geniuses may endure, and if she proves successful, her name will surely be engraved in the history of Endless Witches.

Will she be able to overcome the trials that forced her predecessor to surrender?
# Theories

She is the face of the [[Speculation/Black Magic\|Black Witch]] when Ange faces her.

- [ ] Who is her predecessor? We don't recall Beato ever surrendering.

> [!note]+ Hypothesis
> She is not Eva, not in the same way that MARIA is Maria  or ANGE is Ange. Although she looks like Eva.
> 
> ---
> Leads:
> - Eva was confirmed to be somewhere else entirely when she was committing the last murders.
> - In the meta battle at the end of Banquet, she backs down from claiming she is Eva to instead claiming she isn't human at all.
> - Ange later hints at not taking appearances for granted.

But who's this dipshit if she isn't Eva?

> [!note]+ Kasumi Sumadera is EVA Beatrice.
> If we absolutely must find her an identity among the known characters, it would have to be [[Characters/Kasumi\|Kasumi]].
> 
> ---
> Leads:
> - Kyrie could be said to have surrendered when faced with her family's trials.
> - She does literally show up layered over Kasumi  to represent the [[Speculation/Black Magic\|Black Witch]].
> - There was a big deal in Banquet about the cigarette Kyrie had in her pocket that didn't actually lead anywhere, and later on Kasumi is confirmed to be a smoker.
> 
> Cons:
> - It disqualifies her from being the future Eva we need for [[Characters/Eva#Theories\|this]] theory.
> - The black witch framework is applied to Rosa and Maria as well.

She narrates the Banquest character descriptions.
"If only there wasn't that stupid epitaph, I wouldn't have needed a stake. What a pain."
Did she take on Sayo's role against her will in banquet?

She is either not really present in bamqiuet, or she is person X.
