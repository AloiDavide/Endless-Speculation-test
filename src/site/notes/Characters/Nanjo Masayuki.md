# Descriptions


## Alliance
#### Future

[[Characters/Nanjo\|Nanjo]]'s son. Inherited the Nanjo Clinic.
Unlike Nanjo, he seems to be a more sobered, indifferent person.

After the rampage surrounding Rokkenjima, he grew to completely despise the press, and he never spoke again of what happened around that time.

He once had a daughter afflicted with an incurable disease, but unfortunately, she wasn't able to live out her natural lifespan.
