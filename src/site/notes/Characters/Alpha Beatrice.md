She is the woman Kinzo became obsessed with in his youth.  Because she's at the beginning of everything we'll call her [[Characters/Alpha Beatrice\|Alpha Beatrice]].

# Theories

There's almost no information about this person but we do think she at least existed. In one scene of Legend Genji indirectly places her death before the construction of the mansion in 1952, and we get a pretty good idea of Kinzo's feelings toward her, but it's unknown what exactly their relationship was, or if Beatrice was even her real name.
