This is our theory for Banquet of the golden witch. Surprisingly, this came very soon after the previous one. Hurray!
This was among the easiest ones, except for precisely one detail which was absurdly hard to make sense of. You'll see what we mean soon.

## Part 1: The Witch of the forest
The game opens on a flashback where Beatrice talks with Virgilia. As we know, Beatrice is Sayo. She broke a vase, and she's asking VIrgilia, who is Kumasawa, to repair it with "magic". Kumasawa has used magic as a framing device to comunicate with her, she's playing with her. Again, magic is the power of narratives. Kumasawa makes it so a cat is blamed for breaking the vase, covering for Sayo. Where is this scene happening? we can't know for sure, I'd assume, given that Sayo is that young and is treated as a "princess", I'd say this all happens in Kuwadorian, far from the sight of the rest of the family, which of course knows nothing about this.

The game starts proper, The siblings come to the island. It's worth noting that Rudolph and Hideyoshi are the only people we see smoking, and that Hideyoshi can't turn on his lighter in the strong wind.
The cousins meet Kanon (Sayo) in the rose garden, and then go to the beach. We explore a little bit the fact that Battler promised Shannon that he'll come for her on a white horse or something like that. It's possible that this means something, either related to Sayo or X Beatrice. It could be related to the Promise that Battler made which we'll explore in alliance.

Sayo meets Maria and gives her the letter and umbrella. During dinner Maria reads the letter, and the siblings go meet Kinzo in his room, which of course doesn't answer, because he's dead. Then the kids get chased out of the mansion and sent to the guesthouse to sleep.
The adults discuss what happened, and Rosa freaks out talking about how she is the one who killed Beatrice.
She then tells the story of how she got to the mansion and how Beatrice died under her supervision.

Now. Who is this person that Both Rosa in Rokkenjima and Beato in the tea party are talking about?
Originally Kinzo was helped by someone he considers Beatrice. We'll call this person Alpha Beatrice.
At some point, Alpha Beatrice dies. Kinzo, for some reason, is really obsessed with this individual, so he raises some girl as the golden witch Beatrice. Beato says that she was created in vitro as an homunculus, I believe this might mean that she was adopted, or maybe she was simply the daughter of Alpha Beatrice. We'll call her 0 Beatrice. It really looks like 0 Beatrice has been indoctrinated by Kinzo, and it looks really horrible, especially given how little she knows about the outside world. The servants of Rokkenjima serve in Kuwadorian when they're not in the mansion, Captain Kawabata supplies Kuwadorian. Apparently the mansion has been there since way before Kinzo moved there, because Rosa, who just moved there, finds an opening in the gate caused by an old root breaking it.

At some point before the death of 0 Beatrice, She had a daughter Sayo, or, as hypothesized, 2 daughters, Sayo and X Beatrice. Sayo is raised in Fukin's house, or maybe in Kuwadorian, we don't know if Fukin's house exists. It's possible X was raised, as her mother, to be a replacement Beatrice. That explains why Kinzo would have a portrait of her made.
She looks very similar to X, which is why Rosa is able to mistake her for her mother in Turn.


The rest of the day is quite straight forward. George proposes to Sayo, as always, the siblings discuss, the children sleep in the guesthouse.
