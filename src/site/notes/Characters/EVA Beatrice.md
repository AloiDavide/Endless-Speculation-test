# Descriptions

## Banquet
#### Tea Party

Solved the riddle of [[Tips/The Portrait Epitaph\|the witch's epitaph]] and was welcomed as the new [[Speculation/Endless Witch\|Endless Witch]].
She was gifted with an aptitude for magic and is expected to grow into an extraordinary Great Witch.

This genius of a witch often overindulged in her own power during her younger days.
Such are the trials only geniuses may endure, and if she proves successful, her name will surely be engraved in the history of Endless Witches.

Will she be able to overcome the trials that forced her predecessor to surrender?
