## Axioms
- __The only Master keys are the ones held by the servants, one key each__.
- __There are absolutely no types of hidden doors. This door is the only way in or out__. __The only way to lock this door is with Jessica's single key or the master keys, only one of which is held by each servant__. It is on the second floor, but it is probably possible to enter or leave trough the window. However, __the window is locked from the inside__.
- __[[Characters/Kanon\|Kanon]] was killed in this room__.
- Of course, this door is the same as the chapel. __When locked, it does not permit any form of entry__. I'll say more. __No trick could have the effect of locking the door from the outside without using a key__.
- Let's go back to Jessica's room. __When Jessica's corpse was discovered, only Battler, George, Maria, Rosa, Genji, Gohda, Shannon, [[Characters/Kumasawa\|Kumasawa]], and [[Characters/Nanjo\|Nanjo]] were in Jessica's room__. Whoops, the corpse of __[[Characters/Jessica\|Jessica]] is also included__. __Therefore, both in the case involving Jessica's room and the one involving this servant room, no humans exist that you were not aware of__. __No one is hiding__.
- __No method exists by which the door can be locked from the outside without using a key__. __Regarding the window, no method exists by which it could somehow be locked from the outside__.

In both scenarios the culprits plus Rosa used a master key to set up the closed room and Rosa hid that fact.
