# Descriptions
## Banquet
#### Tea Party

A now-retired [[Speculation/Endless Witch\|Endless Witch]] and [[Characters/Beatrice\|Beatrice]]'s teacher.

She used the Endless Magic properly and devoted her life to the smiles and happiness of many people.

She taught Beatrice the Endless Magic, believing that Beatrice would also devote herself to the people, and retired.

Though she was Beatrice's teacher, she was also a magician employed by Beatrice's family.
For that reason, she interacted with Beatrice in a manner fitting for a servant.
Some point to this as the source of Beatrice's arrogance and recklessness.

# Theories


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



> [!note]- Virgilia is the meta counterpart of Kumasawa
> Like with [[Characters/Genji\|Genji]] and [[Characters/Ronove\|Ronove]], the author has left some very explicit hints to the point that it doesn't even count as deduction.
> 
> ---
> Leads:
> - Virgilia transforms out of Kumasawa on her first appearance on the game board, it's hard to argue with that.
> - She mentions being really old, but she looks quite young in her witch form.
> - Mackerel jokes
> 	- ![Pasted image 20250413161435.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250413161435.png)
> - She is a mentor figure for [[Characters/Shannon\|Shannon]] and [[Characters/Kanon\|Kanon]], aka. [[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]].

> [!note]- Endless magic is a folk tale
> The origin of the [[Speculation/Endless Witch\|endless magic]] narrative is a kind of folklore passed down in [[Characters/Kumasawa\|Kumasawa]]'s family. It pre-dates [[Characters/Kinzo\|Kinzo]]'s golden witch narrative and it could have been a source of inspiration for him, or maybe the two concepts were separate until they were merged by [[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]], who was raised in part by both of them.
> 
> Maria has contributed her imagination and occult hyper fixation, but she didn't come up with the whole thing like we initially theorized. Maybe "gaining endless power" means entering the public consciousness, and the rokkenjima case was instrumental for that to happen with [[Characters/Beatrice\|Beatrice]].
> 
> ---
> 
> Leads:
> - The magical lore fluff in [[Tips/Regarding the Succession of Witches\|Regarding the Succession of Witches]] hints at a long lineage of endless witches, but nothing of the sort exists about the golden witch.
> - [[Characters/Virgilia\|Virgilia]], aka. [[Characters/Kumasawa\|Kumasawa]] is the previous endless witch, but seemingly not a golden witch.

> [!note]- Knowledge of the loops
> Every meta character who sees and references events from multiple episodes is somebody who is aware of the [[Mysteries/Future mysteries/Bottled letters\|Bottled letters]] that have been found in the future.
> 
> This would include:
> - Sayo as Beatrice, Kanon and Shannon
> - \[REDACTED\] as herself
> - Genji as himself and as Ronove
> - Kumasawa as Virgilia
> - Ange (retroactively from the future)
> - EVA Beatrice (either retroactively or because she was actually present there)
> - Possibly Nanjo as Gaap (Gaanjo)
> 
> We notably can't make this claim about Kinzo and Maria.
