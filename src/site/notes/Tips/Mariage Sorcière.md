An alliance of witches formed by lady [[Characters/Maria\|MARIA]], the [[Speculation/Witch of Origins\|Witch of Origins]], and lady [[Characters/Beatrice\|Beatrice]], the [[Speculation/Endless Witch\|Endless Witch]].
Together, they created a groundbreaking magical compendium, which brought about immense influx of strength to Beatrice's once-declining magical power.

It's probably safe to say that the formation of this alliance allowed Beatrice to gain the endless power in its truest sense.

According to its first clause, member witches must acknowledge each other and respect each other's magic.
Young [[Characters/Ange\|Ange]] did receive an invitation to join this alliance at one point, but she was later excommunicated.

We think Ange got in a fight with Maria because she didn't believe in the witch games.
