A repository of every blue truth related to the mechanics of magic in Umineko.

Any scene not witnessed by a character we can trust (in the most strict cases only Battler) is to be taken with an ocean, let alone a grain of salt, but we believe there is still value in examining the magical side of the story, because there are often parallels to be drawn between the magical and the real versions of events.

Or as George Lucas would put it, [it's like poetry, they rhyme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFqFLo_bYq0).

> [!note]+ The red truths are true
> Anything anybody says in red is definitely true. You need to factor in the context it's said in, and there's some leeway due to ambiguity, but if you try to say a false statement you won't be able to finish the sentence, implying the existence of an absolute truth.
> 
> - Why doesn't Battler use this to his advantage to try and repeat his own theories?
> 	- It's either an unspoken rule, or he can only use red truths when given permission by the witch side.
> - For some red truths, it's ambiguous if they hold in general for every episode or not. In those cases we reserve the right to pick what's more convenient. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ 
> - It's also ok to say things in red that have no bearing on the truth of things, such as cackling witch noises and inconsequential taunts.

> [!note]+ Knowledge of the loops
> Every meta character who sees and references events from multiple episodes is somebody who is aware of the [[Bottled letters\|bottled letters]] that have been found in the future.
> 
> This would include:
> - Sayo as Beatrice, Kanon and Shannon
> - X Beato as herself
> - Genji as himself and Ronove
> - Kumasawa as Virgilia
> - Ange (retroactively from the future)
> - EVA Beatrice (either retroactively or because she was there)
> - Possibly Nanjo?
> 
> We notably can't make this claim about Kinzo and Maria.

> [!note]+ The cast isn't fixed.
> The starting conditions of each episode are not fixed. In particular, different people can be on rokkenjima in one episode and not in the next. Such as [[Characters/X Beatrice\|X Beatrice]] and [[Characters/EVA Beatrice\|EVA Beatrice]].
> 
> ---
> Leads:
> - There is a rule according to [[Characters/Bernkastel\|Bernkastel]] that makes this game like a maze that's always shifting.
> - According to [[Characters/Lambdadelta\|Lambdadelta]] beatrice "Will do things like take worthless pieces and place excess pieces on the board to make things more one-sided."
> - It follows nicely from all the episodes also being written tales inside the bottles.
> ---
> Obstacles:
> - Bern was unable to physically insert Ange in Rokkenjima, as there is no possible world where she didn't stay home, but this might just be a consequence of her powers being fundamentally different from those of [[Characters/Beatrice\|Beatrice]].

> [!note]+ Each portrait is a new character.
> Each time a new portrait is shown, it means a new piece has joined the chessboard of Rokkenjima.
> 
> ---
> Leads:
> - It fits with both cases shown so far.
> - It also fits our expectations of [[Erika Furudo\|Erika Furudo]].
> ---
> Obstacles:
> - Alliance didn't have a new portrait and [[Characters/X Beatrice\|X Beatrice]] was very definitely present in it. This would suggest that once you join you're there for good, but in that case why haven't we seen [[Characters/EVA Beatrice\|EVA Beatrice]] again?

> [!note]+ Legend is the "canonical" version of the events.
> We were asked on more than one occasion which episode we expected to be the "real" one.
> We don't know how many if any more games will happen in the answer arcs, so we choose Legend as the most likely candidate from the question arcs.
>  
> ---
> Leads:
> - The first tea party is a direct continuation of Legend, and every following interaction between Battler and Beatrice is framed as a continuation of that one.
> - Beatrice, Shannon and Kanon claim to have seen countless loops already, but this is merely the same magic fluff as the witch killing and reviving someone 100 times.
> - It's not really a question you would ask unless you knew there is an answer.
{ #09e730}



> [!note]+ The "canonical" version of the events will be the one where Battler wins the game.
> We just haven't seen it yet, because the mystery hasn't been solved.
> 
> ---
> Leads:
> - If the truth about what transpired on Rokkenjima were to be revealed, that means Battler will have won and the black box will be broken.
> - The framing of the [[Bottled letters\|Bottled letters]] would suggest that Legend is yet another letter, but who says that any of them recount the real story?

> [!note]+ The Kinzo damage control squad
> It would be fair to say that only people who are aware of Kinzo's death are allowed to have fake scenes where they meet him.
> 
> The people in the know would have to include, at a minimum:
> - Krauss, who is trying to hide the fact from his siblings.
> - Natsuhi, who has no choice other than following Krauss.
> - Nanjo, the physician who regularly took care of him.
> - Genji, who frequently keeps him company.
> - Kanon and Shannon, who are shown serving him his meals inside the study.
> 
> ---
> - Kumasawa is left out the tally because there's no proof akin to the interactions he has with the other servants, but it's possible she knows.
> - As for Jessica she wouldn't interact with Kinzo anyway.
> - Gohda is jut the cook, no reason to tell him.
> 
> Everybody else only comes to the island once every year.

> [!note]+ Shannon and Kanon are the two identities of Sayo
> It started as a meme but there is too much circumstantial evidence to ignore. It seems Shannon, who will be henceforth be called Sayo as she claimed that to be her real name, is not one servant but two.
> 
> ---
> Leads:
> - In 4 episodes they have yet to appear together in a scene where Battler is present. Even when Battler is going around examining every corpse, Kanon is missing.
> - We get down to 16 people this way, there's no other way that isn't extremely contrived.
> - Being made up characters who don't really exist in reality would give sense and pathos to their struggle to be human in the meta narrative. At least for Kanon.
> - Kanon has been working there for only the last three years.
> - Kanon has a feminine voice.
> - Shannon told George her real name, but Kanon couldn't do the same when asked by Jessica.
> 
> Cons
> - Sometimes you need to steer around some reds to claim they always die and live at the same time.
> - Kanon's personal dilemmas at the start of turn are weird under this perspective, but the same scene can also be seen as forshadowing.

> [!note]+ Kinzo created Shannon and Kanon
> Sayo is Kinzo's (not necessarily blood related) granddaughter and daughter of the Beatrice that fell off the cliff 19 years ago. Kinzo wants to hide her identity so he raised her in his Orphanage under a different name.
> 
> Later he made her take on another identity.
> 
> ---
> Leads:
> - The age fits with the timeframe of Rosa's flashback.
> - Shannon is the first furniture created only by Kinzo, Kanon is the second, better made furniture. The problem with Shannon was that she had a heart.
> - Beatrice was raised by Virgilia and she mentions her grandfather in the flashback at the start of Banquet.
>  - It sounds crazy to suggest that nobody would notice if two servants are never together in the same room for years on end, but it becomes a lot more believable when you add Kinzo pulling the strings. Let's also remember that what servants are at the mention often changes, so they wouldn't have to be together so often.

> [!note]+ The witch Beatrice is the stand of Sayo
> Sayo is Beatrice in the sense that she is behind most of the murders. Some part of it might come from Kinzo, but now Sayo is on charge and she aims to make the cases appear magical to Battler. 
> - She has made of her means her ends.
> - Shannon and Kanon have knowledge of the other loops within the magic layer.
> - Endless realization would be a sick stand name.
> 
> ---
> Leads:
> - She is the only person who could have interacted with Maria in Rokkenjima on repeated occasions to create [[Tips/Mariage Sorcière\|Mariage Sorcière]].
> - It's very easy for her to give Maria the letters.
> - Shannon and Kanon come up over and over as possible solutions to the murders.
{ #3df2a4}


> [!note]+ Sayo isn't X Beatrice
> Sayo is distinct from [[Characters/X Beatrice\|X Beatrice]], they are two different people.
> 
> ---
> Leads:
> - The [[Leg Tattoos\|Leg Tattoos]] are too conspicuous of a detail to not be intentional, and they leave no room for doubt.
> - Beatrice is not "one individual woman" according to Bernkastel.
> - The two of them interact in the meta layer near the end of Alliance in a way that suggests two people with similar goals.

> [!note]+ There is only one future
> The future Ange lives in is the only future and it follows from the real course of events, all the different episodes are just different stories passed down as [[Bottled letters\|bottled letters]]. 

{ #589b88}


> [!note]+ Rokkenjima is in a superposition because of the letters
> Nobody really knows what happened there, all we have are the [[Bottled letters\|bottled letters]] all giving a different account of the events, and the four episodes we see are four of such letters, out of an unknown amount. 
> 
> From a magical point of view, it's this uncertainty that allows the entire island to cycle through endless possibilities and be regularly populated by witches and demons. A perfect schrodinger's box.
> 
> ---
> Leads:
> - Beatrice "never lets the dice fall" according to Bernkastel. You never get to see the result so she can keep feeding you different versions of the same story. A true nightmare for someone who systematically rules out wrong approaches like Bern.
> - [[Tips/Bernkastel's letter#Rule Y\|Bernkastel's letter#Rule Y]] : Beatrice has opened up a world in a way none of the other witches expected.

> [!note]+ Kinzo's magical compendium
> It's based on arithmetic miracles, his idea of magic involves taking huge risks for huge rewards. This is probably related to how he became the head of the family apparently by dumb luck, and how he bluffed his way to becoming a millionare by making crazy investments, almost as if he had 10 tons of gold lying around.... Not that the gold ever existed though.

{ #c64381}


> [!note]+ Kinzo summoning Beatrice
> Kinzo's specialty is summoning, he absolutely sucks at everything else. 
> As said in [[Tips/Letter from a Summoner\|Letter from a Summoner]], it's a type of magic that requires a vessel, as well as a huge amount of preparation in order to manifest a miracle permanently.
> 
> It's possible Kinzo's idea of summoning beatrice was to spend a very long time, decades perhaps, to raise a person in isolation and mold her into his ideal of the witch. That unfortunate person would have been [[Characters/0 Beatrice\|0 Beatrice]].
> 
> The vessel idea is also interesting considering he probably was the first to come up with the whole furniture thing.

> [!note]+ Beatrice's Titles
> [[Tips/Beatrice's Titles\|Beatrice's Titles]] ([[Endless Witch\|endless]] and [[Magical Concepts/Golden Witch\|golden]]) might be passed down through different unrelated means.

> But while according to Maria's diary the main criterion for coronating a golden witch seems to be solving the epitaph, the sequence of endless witches as described in the tip seems to be a lot older, pre-dating Virgilia by some generations.
