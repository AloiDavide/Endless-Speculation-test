# Descriptions

## Turn
#### Tea Party

The Witch of Certainty, who has lived for a thousand years.  
She embodies the idea that “hard workers are rewarded” and is revered even by humans.  

Though she is a witch, she does not stray far from the concepts of humans. For that reason, her power as one worshiped by humans is incalculable.  

However, she is fickle about whose efforts she chooses to reward, and in many cases, she bestows her favor upon those who entertain her the most.  

Her immense, swift, and terrifying power can make any witch surrender in an instant.  

However, she is often reckless, and [[Characters/Bernkastel\|Bernkastel]] was able to take full advantage of that.

## Alliance
#### Tea Party

The Witch of Certainty, who has lived for a thousand years. She thinks of [[Characters/Beatrice\|Beatrice]]'s game as a bird cage enclosing [[Characters/Bernkastel\|Bernkastel]]. Her goal is an eternal tie.

She'll ally with Beatrice as a general rule, but she'll support [[Characters/Battler\|Battler]] when it looks like he's about to resign. Then, when it looks like Beatrice is about to be cornered, she'll start supporting the witch again.

The willpower of Certainty is far stronger than the [[Speculation/Endless Witch\|Endless]], which just repeats over and over idly...

If Bern represents the Reader, then Lambda is the author who will keep you hooked, never quite giving you enough of the solution to feel satisfied.
