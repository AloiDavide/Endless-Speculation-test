# Descriptions


## Alliance

One of the 72 Great Demons. Also [[Characters/Beatrice\|Beatrice]]'s friend. When a magician demands it, she grants the ability of instantaneous movement.

She uses this extraordinary power for playing pranks, mostly. Her specialty is hiding keys and bags during busy mornings.

However, in the context of closed room mysteries, this power becomes an ultimate weapon that can easily strike a finishing blow. Her queen bee strikes are likely to pierce any and all detectives, forcing them to surrender.
# Theories

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



> [!tip]- Gaap is the meta counterpart of Nanjo
> Yes, we're serious.
> Look there aren't many options left. It has to be someone involved with Sayo. If it's not [[Characters/Nanjo\|Nanjo]] we're left with just about [[Characters/Kawabata\|Kawabata]].
>
>She is really good at creating closed rooms just like Nanjo when he lies about someone being dead.
>
>We believe in Gaanjo.

> [!tip]- Knowledge of the loops
> Every meta character who sees and references events from multiple episodes is somebody who is aware of the [[Mysteries/Future mysteries/Bottled letters\|Bottled letters]] that have been found in the future.
> 
> This would include:
> - Sayo as Beatrice, Kanon and Shannon
> - [[Characters/X Beatrice\|X Beatrice]] as herself
> - Genji as himself and as Ronove
> - Kumasawa as Virgilia
> - Ange (retroactively from the future)
> - EVA Beatrice (either retroactively or because she was actually present there)
> - Possibly Nanjo as Gaap (Gaanjo)
> 
> We notably can't make this claim about Kinzo and Maria.
