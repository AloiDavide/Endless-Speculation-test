In the future where half of Alliance takes place, accounts of at least the first three games have been recovered inside different bottles in the sea near Rokkenjima.

The legend letter has been signed with Maria's name, but it's not her handwriting, it's the handwriting of the person who Maria knew as Beatrice. Ange was able to know this because of a passage she wrote in Maria's diary.

Hilariously, when compared to Higurashi the game Beatrice plays against Bernkaster is almost literally 4D chess. You have multiple chessboards stacked on top of each other and then you  have pieces like Ange moving along the time axis.
