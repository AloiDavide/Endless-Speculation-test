- [x] Who writes the character descriptions in turn?
Maria and Beato
- [x] Who gave Shannon the motorboat at the start?
Kawabata. He nudges her to go along with the plan so at the end she can plant a fake eva on Rokkenjima.
- [x] What is the brooch about?
The brooch isn't a thing, it's a way to frame the events. Maybe in the endless narrative Beatrice is a framing device for Sayo finding love.
- [x] What is the plot with Shannon/Kanon and Jessica about
Sayo wants to hit on Jessica, but she doesn't know if she's serious with it. It's her trying to understand where her feelings are.
- [x] Who is the Beato that Shannon meets in the portrait room?
It's no one
- [x] Who does Rosa see with Maria that looks like Beato? Actual Beato?
It is X Beatrice. That scene heppened pretty much exactly that way. Rosa is shocked because she sees X Beatrice. This doens't have to mean that Rosa wasn't already in on the plan since before.
- [x] Why does she say that it could have been any of the 4 sibilings to get the letter? what does it say?
It doesn't mean anything.
- [x] Does Kyrie see Beato?
Yes she does
- [x] Why does Rosa say "...I met her!! That was defiintelly a witch...! Believe me!! I definitely didn't see it wrong or allucinate anything! What on earth......was that?!"? she sounds a little bit incoherent
She's thinking about when she met 0 Beatrice.
- [x] How does Maria meet Beato every year?
It's Sayo and/or X Beato
- [x] Why does Shannon immediatly accept the marriage this time?
Because this time Sayo doesn't mean to immediatly fake her death.
- [x] Why the 2 Beatos? how are they interchangable?
Those are X Beatrice and Sayo. One is a person in Rokkenjima, the 17th person, the other one is a framing device to hide the fact that Sayo is doing stuff. You could say that Sayo is Beatrice.
- [x] Why didn't Rosa read her letter?
X Beatrice fucks up in a way, because instead of giving the letter to Maria she gives it to Rosa, which is unreliable. She reads it first, hides it because she doesn't want that info to slip out, and then she gets contacted by Sayo and they do the murders.
- [ ] Why is there written that stuff on the chapel, about this door only opening when a miracle occours?
- [x] Chapel?
Rosa kills everyone with the collaboration of Sayo and Gang. She just happened to be the best person for the role at the time and Sayo takes advantage of it.
- [x] Where did they get the gold?
Sayo had the gold. We think it's possible that Rosa brought the gold from outside, but we weren't able to make that work.
- [x] Jessica's room?
Sayo left the letter when Jessica wasn't looking
- [x] What does Rosa whisper to Nanjo?
She tells them to fake their deaths
- [x] Does Beato keep her promises?
Yes, but what does that meeeeean!
- [x] Servant's room?
Nanjo and Kumasawa fake their deaths. Godha is treathened, if he doesn't go along with it Rosa will just kill them.
- [x] What does it mean that magic layer Shannon knows about Beato erasing Kanon?
Maybe they're telepatically connected, maybe Shannon in the magic layer is also helping Beato, maybe the magic layer is handwaving a lot of details. Maybe she sees that Kanon isn't there and guesses it was magic.
- [ ] Does it matter that Battler was sleeping?
- [x] Nanjo and Kumasawa's corpse
They were simply away and were never killed, but the were killed, in the end, by Genji/Sayo/X Beatrice
- [x] Letter on the table
Rosa put it there to kick out Battler
- [x] Final with Battler
Battler surrendered, so Beato is free to show him magic.
- [x] Why does Rosa run with the gold? what does the whole end sequence with Rosa mean?
It's just magic narrative
- [x] What does it mean that Beato creates pattern?
She wants to make sure that it seems like it's being done by a witch. Maybe to show Battler specifically.
- [x] What does it mean that Beato adds pieces to the gameboard?
It's the 17th person. In this case X Beatrice.

- There is one master key for each servant
- There are only five master keys
- [[Characters/Kanon\|Kanon]] was killed in [[Mysteries/Jessica's Room\|Jessica's Room]]
- Of all the doors that exist on Rokkenjima, none has a crack trough which a key can slip.
