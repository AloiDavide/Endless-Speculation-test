[[Characters/X Beatrice\|X Beatrice]] has a sword wing tattooed on her right leg and nothing on her left.
The same tattoo is on [[Characters/The Chiester Sisters Imperial Guard Corps\|The Chiester Sisters Imperial Guard Corps]] , but not [[Characters/The Seven Stakes of Purgatory\|The Seven Stakes of Purgatory]].

[[Characters/Shannon\|Shannon]] (Sayo) has a wing tattoo on her left leg and none on her right
- This makes her and X beato definitely not the same person.
- As a bonus, she also can't be the bunnies... or the stakes.

Other people who we can confirm have neither mark include:
- Jessica
- Maria
- Ange
- Bernkastel
- Lambdadelta
