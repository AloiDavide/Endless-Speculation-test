## Axioms
- __Natsuhi's room was exactly the same just like usual__! __The door and windows were locked from the inside__. __There were no frauds or tricks, no means of secret passage nor places in which to hide__! __[[Characters/Natsuhi\|Natsuhi]]'s own keys was in [[Characters/George\|George]]'s pocket, and the inside of the room was sealed off__. 
- __All of the master keys were under [[Characters/Rosa\|Rosa]]'s control!__ 
- __After the master keys came into Rosa's control, never did any of them leave her hands! Except for the time when she lent one to Battler to unlock Natsuhi's room.__

> [!note]- Sayo closed the door of Natsuhi's room from the inside and then committed suicide
> Like the previous scene in Jessica's room. This would represent Sayo's black witch coming out on top and killing George and herself in order to create the ultimate meaningless closed room, talk about mistaking the means for the ends.

> [!note]- Rosa somehow left the parlor and used her master keys to close Natsuhi's room
> This is the version of events in which Sayo died early on. Since only Rosa could have closed the room, we are forced to assume she slipped away, possibly while Battler was asleep, and helped with the crime.
