This place you stumbled upon is a golden land born from the efforts of Crunter and HoundDogs.
Through our research, our obsession, and of course a fair amount of copium, we have created our own magic compendium by the name of...
# Endless Speculation.

It's painfully obvious that [[Characters/Battler\|Ushiromiya Battler]] has shown himself to be completely **INCOMPETENT** and **INADEQUATE** at his task. This is nothing short of unacceptable, so it now our duty to succeed where he failed.
Armed with our finest weapons: [[Chekhov's Gun\|Chekhov's Gun]] and [[Occam's Razor\|Occam's Razor]]. We shall defeat the [[Characters/Beatrice\|Golden Witch Beatrice]] at her own game and tear apart her narrative.
This golden land is not only our attack on the [[Endless Witch\|Endless Witch]], but it will also function as our stronghold going forward.

Behold our vast array of facilities.
- A comprehensive list of every single [[Red Truth\|Red Truth]].
- Long-form theories tackling each of the [[Episodes\|Episodes]] in order.
- Notes for every relevant [[Characters\|Character]] with all of their descriptions in each episode and in each plane of existence, as well as all the theories regarding each of them.
- Notes for all the [[Mysteries\|Mysteries]] we aim to solve and our solutions.
- Transcriptions of the important information found in the [[extra tips\|extra tips]], such as the Epitaph and the monologues.
- Many [[Blue Truths/Blue Truths Hub\|blue truths]] holding a claim and our reasoning for it.
