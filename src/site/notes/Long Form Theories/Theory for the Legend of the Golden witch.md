## Preface

First of all, it's important to establish that, most likely, by reading again one more time the first 4 chapters, we would be able to come up with something better. We had to resist the urge to go back to check some stuff, such as compiling all of Beatrice's promises which apparently she keeps, as she says in red [[Red Truth#^4cf967\|here]], but we concluded that it wouldn't be worth to invest more time in this project than we already did.
Second, some theories will be more developed than others. We believe our Legend and Banquet theories are really good, our Turn theory is ok with a lot of "and then this happens", which probably happened, or at least something like that happened. And our Alliance theory, at the time of writing, is pretty garbage (but it functions! from start to finish! they all do!). That is fine to us, the truth is that our notes were pretty good with the exceptions of ironing out the nitty gritty of what happens in between the games, which we would, again, need to read back to understand better, which we aren't going to do.

Second, our theories, in some parts, have multiple solutions that both work. When that happens we will mention them. Sometimes, there are some really clever and appropriate solutions that we weren't able to make fit with a complete solution. Those will be mentioned, as we feel like they probably have some role in the story. Sometimes, one of us feels like a theory functions, the other doesn't. Sometimes, theories might branch up future matters in different directions.
When something like that happens, we will mention it and branch our theories. I'd like to think about this as, unlike a single precise sniper shot, 6 revolver bullets, all very powerful, that are meant to give us some wiggle room in our attack.
We might mention some theories which we don't think are good enough, but that we used to believe in, if they're interesting enough.


Now it's time to showcase the two weapons we're using to zero in on this theory. 
#### [[Occam's Razor\|Occam's Razor]]  and [[Chekhov's Gun\|Chekhov's gun]]

Those 2 are opposites of each others. Occam's razor is meant to cut something short, sometimes we could build some really interesting theory built on some clever element we noticed, and it just doesn't really come together. Occam's razor comes handy to cut it at the root and say "This really simple and basic answer actually works well for the story".
Chekhov's gun, instead, is something we shoot with when we notice some element which is just too juicy and too perfect to just be a coincidence. Sometimes, there is this really satisfying theory that we can't quite make fit with what we know. Chekhov's gun is a way to say: "We are missing something, but as opposed to discarding the theory we will note that there's something missing here, and carry on with it anyway because it would work really well with some other thing we found."
Sometimes, there's a lot of doubt on which of the 2 is best to use. Specifically, we mean to branch our theories in 2 regarding a significant split in how to attack a point, and we will develop 2 theories that are one parallel to each other.


Finally, let's talk about our approach to the credibility of any given scene.
As will become more and more obvious the more we advance, any scene not witnessed by a character we can trust (which in most cases boils down to only Battler) is to be taken with an ocean, let alone a grain of salt, and we reserve the right to call bullshit if we believe the story is trying to trick us.
However, calling a scene fake doesn't make it useless. There is still value in examining the magical side of the story, because there are often parallels to be drawn between the magical and the real versions of events that can strengthen a theory.

Or as George Lucas would put it, [it's like poetry, they rhyme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFqFLo_bYq0)

So now, let's start.


---



The initial scene with [[Characters/Kinzo\|Kinzo]] happens long before the main events of the game, it's Kinzo interacting with [[Characters/Nanjo\|Nanjo]] and [[Characters/Genji\|Genji]] before dying, possibly months before the family conference.
Kinzo is dead. He's been dead for a while at this point, and [[Characters/Krauss\|Krauss]] and every other person that lives in Rokkenjima with the exception of [[Characters/Jessica\|Jessica]] and [[Characters/Gohda\|Gohda]] know it. Everyone is pretending that he's alive per the instructions of Krauss, which is worried about the discovery process of splitting his inheritance.


When the family boards a plane at the airport, we see that for some reason, the pilot of the plane (not a ship) is captain [[Characters/Kawabata\|Kawabata]].
We believe that Kawabata is involved in a larger, as-yet-unidentified scheme, with its primary benefactor being the Ushiromiya group. The goal of this plot appears to be placing "Eva Ushiromiya" in control of the group, and we suspect that Kawabata may be receiving orders from a higher-ranking member within the group, potentially [[Characters/Okonogi\|Okonogi]]. But we will come back to this eventually.

There is a group of individuals on Rokkenjima who aim to carry out a plan that would result in the deaths of everyone present on the island that day, and it must have been premeditated, implying some degree of help from either the Ushiromiya group. 
Based on certain events later the [[Characters/Kasumi\|Sumadera]] family is also suspect, but for now we'll go with the Ushiromiya group.


It's worth noting that there is a scene when the family boarding the plane is going trough a metal detector. I believe that this scene is a red herring for a specific payoff in turn of the golden which, having to do with [[Characters/Rosa\|Rosa]] having brought the 3 bars of gold to Rokkenjima while being the only one that Godha didn't move the baggage to. Unfortunately, I can't make any part of this theory work, and realistically there are other characters in Rokkenjima already that could have stored the gold there. 

Subsequently, the characters are walking towards the mansion, when they stumble upon [[Characters/Kanon\|Kanon]] moving a wheelbarrow to the Garden storehouse.
This is the time to introduce one of the major cornerstones of our theories, we believe that Kanon, and Shannon for that matter, are two identities of a single person, whom will be referred to as [[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]] going forward, for that is the "real" name Shannon told George.
Sayo lives in the orphan house owned by Kinzo, and she fullfils the roles of two different servants in Rokkenjima. Kinzo is aware of this, and so are all the other servants, but no one else is.

We have no clue about their gender, but going off of their depictions and who we believe to be the original person, we'll use feminine pronouns for now.
That's not all the names we will give this character though, because we also believe that Sayo is none other than [[Characters/Beatrice\|Beatrice]]: the [[Speculation/Golden Witch\|Golden Witch]] and [[Endless Witch\|Endless Witch]].

Let's expand on this. We believe that originally, [[Characters/Kinzo\|Kinzo]] was able to further his career by pretending to have an incredible amount of gold, and the original Beatrice, the golden witch, is the person that helped him pull that off. It's very possible that she was also Kinzo's concubine or lover, but the fact of the matter is that this person died and Kinzo couldn't quite get over her. 

The next Beatrice in our timeline is the one from [[Mysteries/Rosa's flashback\|Rosa's flashback]], who was kept in Kuwadorian by Kinzo for many years, and probably even raised there. More about her in the Banquet theory, but Kinzo might have considered her his daughter.
As stated in the [[Red Truth\|Red Truth]], she also died. That was 19 years before the two days when the bulk of every episode takes place in.
For reasons we will explain, again, in later games, we believe that Sayo is a daughter of this second Beatrice. She was sent to the Fukuin house after the death of her mother and raised as a servant instead, but she would frequently visit Kuwadorian, and she would refer to Kinzo as grandfather.

Someone on Rokkenjima has the explicit objective to commit murders in circumstances that will appear magical to any onlookers. Specifically Battler, and possibly including Maria. It would be fairSuch a person We believe Sayo to be that person.
In other words, [[Characters/Shannon#^b88433\|the witch Beatrice is Sayo's stand]].

When it comes to motives there isn't much concrete, maybe she suffers from a sort of "Simulation Complex" that makes her think she's only a character in a broader narrative. Maybe growing up her life was so horrible that, much like Maria, she started believing in her own cope, or 'magic', which she later expanded to include the characters [[Characters/Maria\|Maria]] crafted for her (see [[Speculation/Witch of Origins\|Witch of Origins]]).
![Pasted image 20250325162702.png|400](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250325162702.png)


We believe that Sayo is planning to kill everyone in Rokkenjima during a ceremony which she means to make look like the epitaph of the portrait, and we aren't really sure about the motive.




We believe that Battler's sin is something that has to do with Sayo's sister, and that Battler forgetting his sin trough a domino effect brought to Sayo wanting to perform the events of epitaph. Ultimatelly, she wantes to disseminate the legend of the witch on the rest of the world, by committing the events of Rokkenjima and letting out the bottled letters.
Since in "Memoirs by Lady Lambdadelta" The translator makes a point of writing down that the narrations starts using She to refer to the witch after Lamdadelta grants her desire, and we believe the witch to be Beatrice (and also her alter ego, of course), we believe it's on the table that the reason she's commiting the crimes has something to do with her identity, possibly her crafting multiple identities. We thought about Sayo possibly being split between a male and female identity, Sayo being a trans woman, or Sayo being a trans men since Kanon as a servants appears later. Utimately we abbandoned this theory because we couldn't coalesce it in something of substance.
Sayo has some accomplices, Genji, Kumasawa, Nanjo and in a way Maria too.
Genji helps her because he sees her as the heir of the Ushiromiya family, as she is the daughter of the Beatrice that died 19 years ago in Kuwadorian, which Kinzo loved more that any other son, Kumasawa and Nanjo were promised an incredible amount of money by her, Maria bought the narrative of the endless magic, and it's very possible she doesn't even understand that she's helping her.
Sayo killed Kinzo some months ago to jumpstart her plan. She took the ring seal. She prepared everything she needs for the events of the fatidic day on Rokkenjima, including among other things the stakes.



---

Ok so, back to the events.

We know that there's a problem with all of this. Why is Sayo so nonchalant with Battler potentially touching her boobs in that initial scene in legend? Of course, if Sayo is Kanon, the boobs would need to be fake, right? We believe that the answer to this is that Ryukishi 07 is a bit of a goofy goober that just can't help himself. Something like this happens in higurashi too, where a charachter takes a pointless risk, just because it would work as a great red herring. And well, after all, Battler was \*probably\* never touching her boobs. And the boobs were possibly very well made, right? We'll touch on this on later chapters, but we believe there's an obscene amount of sunstantiation for the fact that Sayo is Shannon, Kanon and Beatrice, so we're willing to say that it's a minor thing.

Now, let's state this; In the context of Legend of the Golden witch, there are 16 people in Rokkenjima.
Krauss
Natsuhi
Jessica
Eva
Hideyoshi
George
Rosa
Maria
Rudolph
Kyrie
Battler
Genji
Sayo
Kumasawa
Godha
Nanjo
Kanon and Shannon are different identities of Sayo. They are the only two people that never appear together in a scene with Battler.
Kinzo is dead. Besides what we know from following games, he is never present in a scene with Battler.

During the scene at the beach, the cousins and Sayo take a glance at Maria's diary. Some things in the diary are part of the murders happening in Rokkenjima. They are elements from Maria's imagination that Sayo implemented to the endless magic narrative, since as it's said in some places, the [[Endless Witch\|Endless Magic]] compendium wasn't completed until Maria added to it the "ability to create 1 from 0"

The epitaph, which we \*definitely\* solved, was written by Kinzo, and Sayo, for some reason, means to commit the murders in Rokkenjima in a way that resemble it.

When Sayo, dressed as Kanon, runs back to tell the cousins the dinner is ready, she stops to give Maria the letter and the umbrella. It's not clear if Maria is complicit to the events of Rokkenjima or if she's just a bystander that goes with Sayo's magical narrative, we tend to believe the second, although the line between the two is for sure really blurry. Like, it's very plausible that Sayo could tell to perform some act for her that will lead to "the magic of the epitaph succeeding", and she might go along with it.

The letter that Maria reads is possibly written by Sayo to put a foot in the mind of the people having dinner to the narrative that magic is real. It's weird because it doesn't strictly talk about magic inside of it, but Sayo delivers it. It's certainly possible that the letter was written by someone else but delivered by Sayo, or something like that, but Occam's razor tells us that she started easy and wrote a letter that would, first and foremost, convince the family that there was someone else in the family dinner, called Beatrice, with a claim to the inheritance, and set asides, at least initially, the magic elements so that it would be easier to believe. We believe that she doesn't think that the gold exists, but she's furthering the narrative about Kinzo having found 1000 ingots. That, to us, is the golden magic, illusory gold that doesn't actually exist, but gains influence the moment you convince people that it exists. We believe that Endless realization is Sayo incorporating the narrative about gold into the narrative of the endless witch.

Krauss shows the gold to Natsuhi; We believe that Kinzo produced a small amount of ingots that work as tokens to illude people with the notion that all the gold exists, and Krauss happened to find one of these ingots, but it's also possible that Krauss forged it so that it can use it as token in negotiations if it turned out to be necessary.

Rudolph tells Kyrie and Battler that he thinks he'll die, we believe it to be a sign that Rudolph is into Sayo's plan to a degree. After all, Ange receives the same letter that Nanjo's and Kumasawa's sons receive, which to me signals that at least one of Ange's parents were in on it. Despite this, we believe that he was used as a possible ally that wasn't necessary to the ceremony, and he ended up playing no role at all, dying immediately on the first twilight. To be precise, we believe that Sayo contacted as many of the adults as possible accomplices for her crimes, with promises of wealth, which they all needed, and didn't tell any of the others about anyone else. Precisely, in this game we believe that Sayo intended to only spare after the first twilight Eva, Hideyoshi, and Natsuhi. Eva and Hideyoshi accepted the collaboration because they desperately needed the gold, with Natsuhi a motif is more difficult. It's very possible that she felt very betrayed about Krauss not telling her anything and not trusting her with the information about the gold he found, it's also very possible that she's very defensive about Jessica's claim to the headship and believes that Krauss wasn't capable of securing a future for her family. It's also possible to say that Natsuhi wasn't ever actually in on the plan. It doesn't really change a lot of our solution otherwise, so we'll go for this one, since, even if it creates some problems in the last beats of the game, makes more sense with motivations.

So.
Eva and Hideyoshi leave the room because they know that Sayo is going to kill everyone. She told them earlier in the day, during a moment where they weren't wit anyone else. Natsuhi either knew too, was lucky to get away, or was informed of the plan while she was away.
Shannon tells Genji, Kumasawa and Nanjo to lie and say the the night shift was moved the following day. She leaves the guesthouse and goes in the mansion, and her following the golden butterflies is a framing device to say that she's following trough with "Beatrice's" plan.

Sayo rushes into the dining room, where the adults are talking, and kills all the remaining adults, plus Godha that just happened to be in the mansion and could hear the sound of the shots, with a winchester with 4+1 bullets. With the help of Genji and Kumasawa they spend the whole night cleaning the dining room and setting up the scene in the shed, which is meant to evoke themes of occult. They have a lot of red liquid that resembles blood, which they use to paint the door of the shed. They set up the five corpses in the shed... but there's another one, isn't it? There are multiple directions we can go to explain it. We can say that what was in the shed wasn't a corpse at all, and was just some kind of mannequin that can be dressed and disguised to look like a corpse. In this way we evade the red. We can say that, since Shannon isn't a person, but an identity assumed by Sayo, anyone disguising with Shannon's clothes is considered "Shannon". In this way we evade the red ||and save us a lot of headhackes for a certain scene in Banquet||. We can also say that Shannon, as an identity, isn't originally Sayo's, but the aforementioned Sayo's sister, and she's the corpse that we find in the shed. It's somewhat strange, but we could say it's Kinzo's body. If we really wanted to, we could easly claim that the corpse in the shed wasn't a corpse at all, but someone alive pretending to be a corpse! After all, we don't \*really\* need to lower the number of people on Rokkenjima to 16, but to 17.
A lot of these options require Nanjo and the adults to lie about the state of the bodies, which we fully expect them to do.
For some details in the following games, we would prefer the number to be 16, se we'll go with the option that it's a mannequin posing as Shannon, and since it's not a corpse, it doesn't count for the red.

In addition to all of this, they also fabricate the scratches on the door of Natsuhi's room, which is meant to increase the suspicion in general, and to gave a pretext for Eva to attack Natsuhi later on in the game. They also disable the phones. Also, Sayo secretly sets up a giant bomb in Rokkenjima, which will blow up on midnight. Yes, that's the best we could do to solve Battler dying at the end of Alliance.

When It's morning, it's not all clean, there is still some to clean in the dining room. Genji and Sayo keep the adults busy by presenting the lack of people, and Genji makes sure that Natsuhi goes in Kinzo's room. Of course both Genji and Natsuhi know that Kinzo isn't there, but to Natsuhi it's a way to explain him out, and to Genji it's a way to fabricate conflict later on that can be used to frame her as a possible culprit.
Then they push the adults to find the scene of the crime in the garden shed, all of this while gaining some time for Kumasawa to finish cleaning the dining room.

When they find the corpses, everything happens as it's shown in the story. The important element here is that Eva and Hideyoshi, and partially Natsuhi too, are very adamant that the children don't come in the shed, and especially don't see Shannon. I believe that there may be many explanations for why that's the case, but first let's establish this; It's very possible that Hideyoshi could have guessed what was supposed to be on Shannon's ring by the way George asked the question, it's possible that Hideyoshi heard it from Rudolph, which was present near the bathroom stall when George was practicing proposing, It's possible that Sayo just told him for some reason, and It's possible that they wanted to keep him away to not reveal that the corpse wasn't actually Shannon. Nanjo's word is worth nothing, and we can only guess.

Let's go with this; It's a mannequin wearing Shannon's clothes. Natsuhi sees it but doesn't get closer, Hideyoshi and Eva tell her that the police should make it so they don't tamper the scene or something. Then Eva and Hideyoshi make sure that no one else can see anything to keep the secret while Nanjo lies, and the only person that is able to get closer at all is Battler, but he doesn't see anything.

When Natsuhi and Eva both go back to see if Kinzo is there, Natsuhi is forced to let Eva in, and of course Kinzo isn't there at all. This could either be a coincidence or an information that Sayo gave Eva to use as a weapon against Natsuhi.

Maria doesn't freak out when she hears that deaths are happening, because she's already been conditioned by Sayo to think this is only the magic of the epitaph, and everyone will come back alive at the end of the day.

In the scene when everyone in the room sees Beatrice but Battler, the explanation is easy. Everyone there is in Sayo's narrative. Genji and Kumasawa are there lying for Sayo, and Maria is just telling the truth, since Sayo, Beatrice, is there after all.

During the events, Eva is intentionally trying to seed conflict, to frame anyone else which isn't her, initially the servants, and finally Natsuhi, which she attacks with the receipt trick. When it doesn't work out, she retires to her room, because, knowing that Sayo is the culprit, she feels safe.

Now, there are two direction we could go towards. We could say that Eva and Hideyoshi murders were legitimate or that they were faked, and Nanjo is lying about the fact that they are dead.

In the second case, we would be able to say that Eva survives the games and ends up being alive in Ange's future, but we end up stumbling in a problem, the red "Due to your sin, a great many humans on this island die. No one escapes, all die.". We have mixed feelings about this red, especially the "no one escapes, all die." part, we are not quite sure what it's referring to, but we overall decided that letting people escape Rokkenjima, even this first Rokkenjima which happens before Battler in the tea party starts actively playing against Beatrice in the tea party, is probably not a valid solution. Just, it's there and it's a spin you can use. Just, you have to say that Hideyoshi was killed in a homicide later in the day with the killer in the same room, and that Eva too was killed in an homicide, with poison or something, by someone in her same room. Instead, we'll go with the first one, Eva and Hideyoshi felt safe, but Sayo betrays their trust, she makes them open the door with any pretext, then kills them with shots on the body parts meant to be part of the epitaph.

They turn on the incinerator where Kinzo's body was stored all along, they paint the door and prepare the letter, very quickly, before they're afraid about anyone sneaking in the scene. That's why the letter is so bief. Then they simply lie about the fact that the chain was intact, after they finished preparing everything they start making a lot of noise to lure everyone there.
When the smell comes from the boilers room, Sayo and Kumasawa run there to fabricate a fake homicide, Sayo prepares a bag of fake blood in her clothes, and then pretends to have been stabbed by the stake. Nanjo lies when he says that Kanon is dead, it's but a ploy for Sayo to be able to roam free to do whatever she wants  to. The golden butterflies are a framing device to kick Kanon out of the equation.

Genji proposes hiding in Kinzo's study. This was already planned, and He has a letter to set up.
They go in, at the opportune moment He pulls out a letter which Maria notices, which makes Natsuhi kick out everyone that she knew not to be safe.


They go back to the parlor, thinking they're safe. Whatever they were told about how the plan would work out, they didn't expect Sayo to show up with a gun, which she pointed to Genji, Kumasawa and Nanjo, as they begged for mercy. She told Maria to turn the other way, and to sing, and when she did that she killed everyone else and set up the room with the stakes and all, then called Kinzo's room with the phone that she adjusted when she had some free time, and left. It's on the table that she actually leaves that letter that later on Maria says Natsuhi went away while reading.

Natsuhi and the cousins go to the parlor, and they see the scene. Natsuhi leaves, and it's not clear why she does. Maybe, the actual solution is that she's complicit with Sayo too. Maybe, she was menaced with a gun behind the back, told that if she obeyed the kids would be spared, and Maria is actually just lying. I feel like it's not too unrealistic to say that she actually found a letter that says something like "the final showdown, just you and me, if you come I'll spare everyone else.". Whatever it is, she leaves and is killed in front of the portrait room, by Sayo's bullet. It's very possible that they both shot at the same time and killed the other person, from this point onward we don't need Sayo to be alive.

The children come in front of the painting, and whatever happens doesn't really matter, I feel like they just found Natsuhi's body and Maria started acting creepy. Shortly after, the bomb that Sayo set up explodes.

After the explosion, Kawabata comes to Rokkenjima, and sets up on Kuwadorian a fake Eva Ushiromiya that was set up by whoever is collaborating with Sayo from Outside of Rokkenjima, probably the Ushiromiya group. when going back to Rokkenjima, for some reason, he finds the plush of Sakutarou, which Rosa either rebuilt or repaired, feeling bad for Having destroyed Maria's one and wanting to give it back to her, and it eventually ends up in the hands of his nephew, in the display case where Ange later sees it.

This is the game from which the future branches out, but we'll touch on all of that later.

The police comes to Rokkenjima and finds all the horrible murders, including Maria's jaw, only piece survived from the explosion. Sayo's writings, the letters in the bottles, are disseminated by Kawabata shortly after the events.

The tea party is the "magic" version of events, the point at which almost everyone bought in Sayo's narrative. Beatrice, which is Sayo, feels like she didn't "complete her ritual", and, at least initially, means to convince Battler of her existence. Or that's how it appears on the surface. We'll talk about this later in more details.
At a certain point, the way Maria talks makes it seem like she met and talked with the witch of miracles. I believe that Bernkastel was part of Maria's endless witch narrative, ||possibly picked up partially by Higurashi since it's actually a book that exists in the world of Umineko.

The charachter profiles of the last people dying say that they went to hell, and yet they're in purgatory. We believe that hell is inside of the games, as they were placed in the next chessboard. The red outline section of every tips following Legend, if you will.

Purgatory AKA the tea party is some kind of dimension in which  Beato is trying to convince everyone that She's real so they can move on to the golden land, at least on the face of it.
After the scuffle in the tea Party, Beato and Battler start their game.

---
## Tea party of those who are not human

The tea party of those who aren't humans, is  not a golden land, but a dimension above the tea party.
There, Bernkastel was playing a game against Beato. What we saw was Bernkastel seeing the magical framing device with which Beato was trying to convince her of her narrative. Nominally, Beato was just showing her "Something cool". They both act like they aren't playing against each other, but even at this point both know they are. The POV characters, at least initially, are Battler and Bernkastel. After all, her charachter profile directed to us the reader tells us: "Sometimes she is you, and sometimes she is your greatest friend".

Beato talks with Bern, her "not even letting the dice fall" might mean that she literally min-maxes every aspect of the game to fit her narrative, but it could also mean that she plays scenarios that are already resolved, and is only playing with stories. Maybe it refers to her not letting the events on Rokkenjima resolve truly, on the magic framing.

When Bernkastel breaks the 4th wall, she could either refer to the reader or to Battler in that higher plane, or to both. Let's say, for the sake of simplicity, that she's referring to Battler.
Beatrice is not "One individual woman" refers to the whole Sayo thing.
"Her existence is the personification of the rules of this world" refers to "Endless realization", which sets up the whole magical compendium on Rokkenjima.

Beatrice's profile says that there is only one way to kill her, and We hold it on the palm of our hands. This might mean a lot of things. Is it about Battler having an easy out, ignoring Beatrice? Is it about her having one glaring weakness that we couldn't identify? Is it the reader closing the game and not playing anymore? Please tell me it's not the reader closing the game and not playing anymore, it's so cliche! Although, it probably wasn't when Umineko came out.

### Rudolf will be killed
Wtf does he mean?

### Krauss finds the gold
We can't take the scene for granted so idk if it's real

### The scoprion charm

We have to explain the red liquid on the door
Maybe the servants saw the charm get into Natsuhi's hands? 
apparently no

### Schrodinger's grandfather

While six people are missing, Natsuhi receives the key to Kinzo's study from Genji and goes to check on him.

Let's briefly talk about Kinzo. The thing about him is... he's dead. 
We don't know when or how he kicked the bucket, but we suppose it wasn't peaceful.


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">

</div></div>


You can see how this makes the heartwarming scene of Natsuhi finally getting praised an impossibility (although we like to think it still holds weight for her characterization, as Ange would say, this is her magic).

As it will become obvious later on, any scene not witnessed by a character we can trust (in the most strict cases only Battler) is to be taken with an ocean, let alone a grain of salt, but maybe there is still some value in this kind of scenes.

We can often draw parallels between them and the real events. For instance, interacting with Kinzo might be a sign that a character is in on the secret.

### The first twilight

The servants had the key of the shed.
What happened with the adults? Why did some die and others survived?
Blood in the dining hall means that it was the crime scene.

We have no red truths other than __I guarantee the identities of all unidentified corpses. Therefore, there were no body double tricks!__ 
And that was said about a completely different scene.

They didn't want them looking at the corpse of shannon

Afterward they lock the door and Natsuhi holds onto the key from that point forward, so anyone alive inside would be left there with the corpses?



<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



> [!failure]+ Shannon 's corpse in legend is [[Characters/X Beatrice\|X Beatrice]]
> The supposed corpse of Shannon isn't hers and it also isn't a corpse. That is simply [[Characters/X Beatrice\|X Beatrice]] trying to hide herself with the help of the adults.
> 
> ---
> Leads:
> -  We can beat the red by simply claiming that the person there wasn't dead and thus not an unidentified corpse.
> - Maybe after seeing the spitting image of Beatrice the Ushiromiya parents want to keep it a secret.
> ---
> Obstacles:
> - Does the motive make any sense with the whole murder going on? Would this be the priority of a bunch of greedy but otherwise innocent people? And are the kids really the ones to whom this secret needs to be kept?
> - We would rather X Beatrice not be in Legend because it breaks another theory.

</div></div>



Then maybe unidentified corpse has a weird definition, or it was a mannequin, but what were the adults other than nanjo smoking?


About the ring, Sayo obviously knows about it and maybe Hideyoshi heard it from Rudolf.



---

### Is Natsuhi sus?

Natsuhi sends Genji to contact the police while she goes to check on Kinzo. Eva insists on following her this time.

As they come back they explain that Genji couldn't get the phone to work, and that Kinzo is mysteriously gone from his study.

Later, while Battler and Eva have their detective conversation about the first twilight, this time Natsuhi goes out only accompanied by the servants to check all the doors and windows, then she returns with a winchester.

It's curious how this same series of actions (going to the study to check on Kinzo and fetching a gun with the servants) will be repeated by Rosa during [[Turn of the Golden witch\|turn]], and she will also lie about Kinzo. But this isn't the time or place. 


Does the fact Natsuhi wasn't killed mean she's a wolf working with the perpetrators?
Our aim is to minimize the 'wolves' so let's try to find some reason why they wouldn't attack her when given the chance.
- They were aiming to kill two people together for the second twilight.
- They needed setup time.
- They figured it would make them too suspicious?

---

Eva gets suspicious so she challenges Natsuhi with the receipt trick.
Whether Eva really placed the receipt there, or she came up with it as a bluff really doesn't matter. 
What's relevant is that Natsuhi couldn't do anything to deny this accusation, but of course, there is a simple reason for that outside of being the culprit.


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



> [!note]+ The receipt is not proof against Natsuhi
> Needless to say, Natsuhi wasn't really the last person to see Kinzo before he disappeared, but she had to lie about seeing him because she couldn't let anyone know Kinzo was dead from the start, despite how suspicious it made her look at that moment.

</div></div>


---

After that, all the remaining servants plus Nanjo have a scene together in the kitchen.
On the surface they are simply mourning the death of Shannon. This is what the unreliable narration claims.


### [[Mysteries/Eva and Hideyoshi's room\|Eva and Hideyoshi's room]]
This is a very straight forward case of a group of culprits making up alibis for each other.


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



> [!note]+ Eva and Hideyoshi's closed room was not a closed room
> No closed room existed there, it's just what [[Characters/Kanon\|Kanon]] and [[Characters/Genji\|Genji]] said.
> 
> ---
> Leads:
> - Nowhere does the red explicitly state that this case fits the definition of a [[Mysteries/Beatrice's Definitions#^45ecae\|closed room]].
> - Nor does it negate any method by which the perpetrator could enter the room, it only states that they were murders carried out inside the room.
> - Genji and Kanon claimed that the door was shut and they were forced to break the chain, when they could have just as easily have forced their way in, or persuaded Eva to open the chain.
> - Naturally, the letter was planted by them as well, after all it simply said "Praise my name", they must have been in a hurry with all the relatives waiting for them to return.

</div></div>


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



> [!note]+ Kanon and Genji made the magic signs on Eva's door.
> According to the narration, Kanon would have gone to featch a wire cutter with Kumasara, and upon getting back they found a magic circle that wasn't there just a few minutes earlier.
> 
> That is a falsehood.
> 
> ---
> Leads:
> - There is no reason to believe this claim, as the only witnesses to any of it are our prime suspects.
> - Even Kanon having to retrieve a tool to break the chain is something only Kumasawa and Nanjo can confirm. They could have had it with them from the beginning.

</div></div>


---

### The [[Mysteries/Boiler room\|boiler room]]

A foul smell of burning flesh leads Kanon and Kumasawa to investigate the basement where Kanon confronts Beatrice and is Badly wounded. 
He dies offscreen under the supervision of Nanjo.

- __All of the survivors have alibis! Let us include the dead as well!! In short, no kind of human or dead person on the island could have killed [[Characters/Kanon\|Kanon]]!__
- __Kanon did not commit suicide__
- __Kanon did not die in an accident__!


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



> [!note]+ Kanon did not die... at all!
> Why assume he died when they could just as easily have faked it.
> 
> ---
> Leads:
> - Kanon supposedly pulls out the stake from his chest before being found.
> - They had plenty of fake blood to make the magic circles.
> - Beatrice refuses to repeat that it was a homicide.
> - We already think Nanjo is lying.
> - We couldn't figure out another way around the red.
> ---
> Obstacles:
> - Jessica supposedly witnessed his death because she was taking care of him the whole time, but she also would have believed the doctor in the room when he declares someone dead.

</div></div>



What about the closing door Kumasawa and Kanon heard from the basement?
- As for the closing door they heard, just like with the previous murder we can't trust the unreliable narration.
"According to Genji-san the boiler room is usually locked."
- Nothing according to Genji is reliable.
"After all, the doors and windows throughout the mansion had been checked."
- By the servants and Natsuhi, who could have taken a different route.


### [[Characters/Kinzo\|Kinzo]]'s corpse
Kinzo, whom we know was dead from the beginning, is found charred inside the incinerator he was the source of the smell.


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



> [!note]+ Kinzo's burned corpse
> Kinzo's body was burned in the incinerator recently.
> 
> ---
> Leads:
> - First things first, because the identity of all unidentified corpses in Legend has been guaranteed in red, that is indeed Kinzo's body.
> - The body couldn't have been burning for longer than several hours or a day at most, or they would have noticed the smell a lot sooner.
> - It's unlikely they left it to rot in the studio it must have been stored somewhere such as a coffin in the chapel.
>- Or maybe it was in the boiler room but it was only incinerated later.

</div></div>


That said, who is to blame for it?
We have a couple theories, the first is straight forward, but it leaves a few gaping holes.


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



> [!note]+ Krauss burns Kinzo in the boiler room
> It was probably done under orders from Krauss, as an attempt to hide it from all the relatives. 
> He probably didn't think of the smell. He was never the brightest.
> 
> ---
> Leads:
> - Of the people most likely to know about Kinzo's death, he the only one to not feel much affection or respect for the old man.
> - Everyone else would have to obey him as either his employee or overly subservient wife.
> ---
> Obstacles:
> - What reason was there to incinerate the body? Did he think nobody would notice the fingers?
> - The body was never found in [[Turn of the Golden witch\|turn]] and there is no mention of the smell, leading us to believe he wasn't burned in that instance. But why? Was the presence of [[Characters/X Beatrice\|X Beatrice]] a deterrent?
> 	- No it wasn't, after all she is also there in [[Alliance of the Golden witch\|Alliance]].

</div></div>



The second theory is a lot more sturdy... however it will take more than this episode to get the full picture.


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



> [!note]+ The servants burn Kinzo in the boiler room
> The servants are trying to push the narrative of magical murders, so they slowly incinerate Kinzo so that his body will be found with a delay. 
> 
> ---
> Leads:
> - The gross smell is always going to lead to someone discovering the body eventually. Burning the corpse is something you should only do if you plan for it to pop up at some point.
> - Either they move it, or maybe it really was placed there by Krauss to hide it, and all they do is turn on the heat.
> - In Turn, Kinzo was simply never designated as a victim, perhaps due to the interference of [[Characters/X Beatrice\|X Beatrice]] on Sayo's plan.
> ---
> Obstacles:
> - It's hard to believe Genji would do something like that to his former master... unless he believes his new master to be someone with equal or higher authority, someone like Beatrice.

</div></div>

### Kinzo's study
Genji ci da della lore su beatrice ma non serve specularci ora, la menzioniamo quando si parla di 0 Beatrice


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



> [!note]+ Maria placed the letter on the table in the study
> The golden witch, that is to say Sayo, gave her the letter and told her to make it look as if the it appeared out of thin air. So that is exactly what she did. 
> 
> ---
> Leads:
> - Maria is the first to point out the letter while everyone else was focused on something else.
> - She clearly enjoys spooking people who don't believe in witches.
> - She thinks Beatrice can't get inside because of the scorpion charm, so the task is up to her.
> - Alternatively it could have been one of Genji, Nanjo or Kumasawa, but the naive placement points us more toward Maria.

</div></div>




Wasn't the phone line broken?
Either that's a lie, or like it will be justified in alliance only the line to outside the island has been cut.

---

### The parlor
After the phone call with Maria singing, Natsuhi's group goes down to the Parlor and finds the door locked.

- __[[Characters/Maria\|Maria]], who was in the same room, did not kill them! And of course, their three deaths were homicides!__
- __I guarantee the identities of all unidentified corpses. Therefore, there were no body double tricks!__
- __[[Characters/Genji\|Genji]], [[Characters/Kumasawa\|Kumasawa]], and [[Characters/Nanjo\|Nanjo]] are not killers__!


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



> [!note]+ The servants were betrayed in the parlor
> Sayo couldn't get into the study because it was locked, so she had to turn on her allies as a means to reach her goal... no, as a goal to reach her means.
> 
> After killing them she started the phone call, left the room, and locked it the same way she opened it. With a master key.
> 
> ---
> Leads:
> - Gengi, Kumasawa and Nanjo had accepted their exile from the study without much of a fuss. They didn't think they were in much danger.
> - The parlor was supposedly locked too, but the culprit would have had a master key, and it's possible the three let the intruder in willingly thinking it was an ally.
> - Without any red truth regarding the master keys, this is not a closed room at all.

</div></div>



<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



> [!note]+ Genji, Kumasawa, and Nanjo are not killers
> - Nanjo wasn't directly involved in any killing, all he did was lie.
> - Kumasawa likewise didn't kill anybody herself, she would have been overpowered. Even if we suppose she attacked Kanon, he didn't die.
> - This is a problem for Genji, but maybe one person is enough to carry out the murders and he just watches?
> 
> Alternatively this red isn't so broad and it only refers to that scene in the parlor.

</div></div>






According to maria Natsuhi finds another letter and darts out without saying a word.

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



> [!note]+ The letter Natsuhi found in the parlor was a threat
> 
> 
> ---
> Leads:
> - The only reason she would leave without telling anybody is that she was forced to.
> ---
> Obstacles:
> - The culprit couldn't guarantee who would read the letter, so it can't be something aimed at Natsuhi specifically.

</div></div>



---

### Natsuhi's death

- __Natsuhi's death was a homicide! There were no unidentified corpses, and all of the survivors have alibis!__
- __The bullet buried into Natsuhi's forehead was not fired from her gun!__
- __The thing that shot Natsuhi wasn't a trap, it was a real shooting murder with a gun raised and trigger pulled!__


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



> [!note]+ Natsuhi's death in Legend
> She was shot by Sayo, who is still alive unbeknownst to us.
> 
> ---
> Leads:
> - There is a contradiction between the first red and the final one (thanks Lambdadelta), so we are forced to restrict the first to include among the survivors only the people we are aware of at that moment, not any other potential  alive person on the island.
> - We know from later episodes that there are multiple winchesters.

</div></div>




It's worth mentioning a previous theory that no longer holds much credibility.

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



> [!failure]+ Natsuhi gets replaced in Legend
> Natsuhi was shot at some point previously, maybe during the murder of the first twilight, and from that point forward somebody else impersonates her. At the end her actual corpse is taken out
> 
> ---
> Leads:
> - It explains why she would run away from the parlor.
> - It solves the red with no extra people at the end.
> 
> ---
> Obstacles:
> - We ran out of possible candidates.
> - If our culprit X is Natsuhi who is always with battler at the end, who's killing people?
> - Convincingly passing as somebody else is quite hard when you think about it, you would need a lot of practice.

</div></div>

What happens to everyone? Is it a bomb behind the portrait?

The credits say this account is written by Maria, but that isn't true. Not only it's out of character but it also is disproven in Legend.

### The tea party


So the game starts here

What is the real version of the events?


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



> [!note]+ Legend is the "canonical" version of the events.
> We were asked on more than one occasion which episode we expected to be the "real" one.
> We don't know how many if any more games will happen in the answer arcs, so we choose Legend as the most likely candidate from the question arcs.
>  
> ---
> Leads:
> - The first tea party is a direct continuation of Legend, and every following interaction between Battler and Beatrice is framed as a continuation of that one.
> - Beatrice, Shannon and Kanon claim to have seen countless loops already, but this is merely the same magic fluff as the witch killing and reviving someone 100 times.
> - It's not really a question you would ask unless you knew there is an answer.

</div></div>



<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



> [!note]+ The "canonical" version of the events will be the one where Battler wins the game.
> We just haven't seen it yet, because the mystery hasn't been solved.

> Leads:
> - If the truth about what transpired on Rokkenjima were to be revealed, that means Battler will have won and the black box will be broken.
> - The framing of the [[Bottled letters\|Bottled letters]] would suggest that Legend is yet another letter, but who says that any of them recount the real story?
