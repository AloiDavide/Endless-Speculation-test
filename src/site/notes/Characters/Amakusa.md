# Descriptions


## Alliance
#### Future

A former guard of [[Characters/Eva\|Eva]]’s.
He’s fundamentally a thrillseeker, willing to take on dangerous jobs for very little pay.

At one point, he did work as a guard for [[Characters/Ange\|Ange]], but after repeatedly violating Eva’s strict orders not to speak to her, Eva grew to dislike him and fired him.

Ange seemed not to mind having him around, as he would often chat with her.

This man, who has travelled between the Japan Self-Defense Force, the Foreign Legion, and non-government military companies, has skill in counter-sniping and protecting VIPs.

Apparently he used to work under [[Characters/Okonogi\|Okonogi]] at their previous job too.
