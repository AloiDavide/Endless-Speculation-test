# Descriptions


## Alliance
#### Future

A leading member of the Ushiromiya Group.
Between the time of [[Characters/Eva\|Eva]]’s death and Ange succeeding her position, management of the Group has fallen to core members like him in her stead.

However, [[Characters/Ange\|Ange]] has no desire to inherit that role, leaving the Group on the brink of fracturing internally and putting Okonogi in a difficult position.

He was once the president of a foodstuffs distribution company and had an intimate relationship with [[Characters/Hideyoshi\|Hideyoshi]]’s business.

Because of that long-lasting association, Eva trusted him particularly, and he was appointed to an important post within the Group.
# Theories

It seems this is canonically that same Okonogi, we fully expect him to be part of some conspiracy because why wouldn't he?
Did he play a role in planting the fake Eva in Kuwadorian? Maybe.
He probably wasn't a leader in the Ushiromiya group just two years after Higurashi, he rose up the ranks in the 12 years since.
