# Descriptions


## Legend
#### Rokkenjima

The leader of the servants who work for the Ushiromiya family.

He has served [[Characters/Kinzo\|Kinzo]] longer than any other and is the person most trusted by that old man.

Since he serves Kinzo directly, [[Characters/Krauss\|Krauss]] and [[Characters/Natsuhi\|Natsuhi]] think of him as being a spy for Kinzo.

---
Found in the [[Mysteries/Episode 1 mysteries/Servants deaths in the parlor\|parlor]]. He had a weapon resembling an [[Characters/The Seven Stakes of Purgatory\|icepick]] sticking out of his stomach, and his face had been smashed.

At the sixth twilight, gouge the stomach and kill.
## Turn
#### Rokkenjima

The leader of the servants who work for the Ushiromiya family.

He has served [[Characters/Kinzo\|Kinzo]] longer than any other and is the person most trusted by that old man.

Since he serves Kinzo directly, [[Characters/Krauss\|Krauss]] and [[Characters/Natsuhi\|Natsuhi]] think of him as being a spy for Kinzo.

---
Missing.  

Selfless furniture seeks nothing but repose in the Golden Land.  
However, since a fool obstinately rejects the Golden Land, it seems his time of repose is unlikely to come soon.  

Afterwards, he was torn to pieces and eaten by demons and went to hell.
#### Tea Party

Kinzo’s earliest furniture, which he created to serve him and him alone with complete loyalty.  

Though he was Kinzo’s first creation, he was made with the help of a high-class demon, so while there were several defects in his initial specifications, he conceals a great potential within himself.  

In the many years following that, he continued to mature and compensate for his many deficiencies, turning himself into the nearly flawless butler furniture that he is now.  

He is approaching the limit of his service life, but the magical power he can unleash for an instant rivals Kinzo’s. 
## Banquet
#### Rokkenjima

The leader of the servants who work for the Ushiromiya family.

He has served [[Characters/Kinzo\|Kinzo]] longer than any other and is the person most trusted by that old man.

Since he serves Kinzo directly, [[Characters/Krauss\|Krauss]] and [[Characters/Natsuhi\|Natsuhi]] think of him as being a spy for Kinzo.

---
His body was found in the [[Mysteries/VIP Room\|VIP Room]] on the second floor.  

The weapon used on him is assumed to be a [[Characters/The Chiester Sisters Imperial Guard Corps\|gun or spear-shaped object]].

To thank Genji for his many years of service, let us allow him to rest in the VIP room.
## Alliance
#### Rokkenjima

The leader of the servants who work for the Ushiromiya family.

He has served [[Characters/Kinzo\|Kinzo]] longer than any other and is the person most trusted by that old man.

His corpse was found in the [[Mysteries/Dining hall\|Dining hall]].  
About half of his head was destroyed. It's probably reasonable to assume that he was murdered with a [[Characters/The Chiester Sisters Imperial Guard Corps\|powerful gun]] or something similar.  

However, the witnesses don't believe he was killed with a gun...
# Theories

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



> [!note]- Ronove is the meta counterpart of Genji
> [[Characters/Ronove\|Ronove]] is closely related to [[Characters/Genji\|Genji]], although they are two distinct entities in the magical interpretation.
> 
> **Evidence:**
> - Genji's last name is Ronoue.
> - When Genji is described as Furniture in [[Characters/Genji#Turn\|Genji#Turn#Tea Party]], it is mentioned that an high ranking demon helped [[Characters/Kinzo\|Kinzo]] in his construction. 
> 	- The idea that unlike [[Characters/Shannon\|Shannon]] and [[Characters/Kanon\|Kanon]] he wasn't totally Kinzo's creation maybe hints at the fact that unlike them, [[Characters/Genji\|Genji]] wasn't raised with this framing and only later developed his devotion to the role for unknown reasons.
> - When [[Characters/Ronove\|Ronove]] fights [[Characters/Jessica\|Jessica]] in alliance, she mistakes him for [[Characters/Genji\|Genji]], then he calls the servant his "little brother" and "vessel", not unlike [[Characters/Virgilia\|Virgilia]] and [[Characters/Kumasawa\|Kumasawa]].

> [!note]- Sayo's required accomplices all have a motive to help
> The other servants plus Nanjo all have motivations to be accomplices of Beatrice.

> ---
> Leads:
> - Genji would do anything related to Kinzo's will. Or alternatively he's following Sayo as his new master after Kinzo died because he sees her, Beatrice, as the true heir.
> - Nanjo wants money for his sick grand daughter and Ange shows us that's exactly what his family received.
> - Kumasawa's family also got the money, and she has a personal attachment to Sayo.
> - Gohda will comply if threatened, he probably isn't even in on the plan from the start.
> - This is probably circular evidence, but Ronove Viriglia and Gaap are shown taking orders from Beatrice, implying a relationship of servitude.
