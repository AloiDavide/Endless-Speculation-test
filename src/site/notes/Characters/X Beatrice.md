# Theories

Formerly known as student Beato, by us, who gaslit ourselves into thinking that was a student uniform and then were not able to stop calling her that before finally coming up with the current name.

She is the 19th person X on Rokkenjima, at least in turn and alliance.

She is the most likely to be the the model for the Beatrice portrait.
