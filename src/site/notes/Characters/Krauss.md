# Descriptions

## Legend
#### Rokkenjima

[[Characters/Kinzo\|Kinzo]]'s first child.

As the oldest of the four siblings, he leads the family conference. However, the other siblings think he is trying to get all of the inheritance for himself, and this further strains the tensions between them.

He is a real estate investor and has put a lot of money into the development of a resort. However, his results have been harshly criticized.

---
His corpse was found inside the [[Mysteries/Episode 1 mysteries/Rose garden storehouse\|Rose garden storehouse]]. The direct cause of death is unknown, but it seems the side of his head was smashed after his death.

This is the beginning of everything.

## Turn
#### Rokkenjima

[[Characters/Kinzo\|Kinzo]]'s first child.

As the oldest of the four siblings, he leads the family conference. However, the other siblings think he is trying to get all of the inheritance for himself, and this further strains the tensions between them.

He is a real estate investor and has put a lot of money into the development of a resort. However, his results have been harshly criticized.

---
His corpse was found in the [[Mysteries/Episode 2 mysteries/Crime scene in the chapel\|Chapel]].  
The direct cause of death is unknown, but it seems his stomach was cut open and his intestines pulled out after his death.  
On top of that, sweets and candies were packed into his stomach.  

Welcome, [[Characters/Maria\|Maria]].  
Happy Halloween.
## Banquet
#### Rokkenjima

[[Characters/Kinzo\|Kinzo]]'s first child.

As the oldest of the four siblings, he leads the family conference. However, the other siblings think he is trying to get all of the inheritance for himself, and this further strains the tensions between them.

He is a real estate investor and has put a lot of money into the development of a resort. However, his results have been harshly criticized.

---
His corpse was found in the rose garden arbor.
The cause of his death is assumed to be strangling with a [[Tips/The Chiester Golden Bows\|rope-like object]]. A [[Characters/The Seven Stakes of Purgatory\|stake-shaped weapon]] was sticking out of his thigh.  

If only there wasn't that stupid epitaph, I wouldn't have needed a stake. What a pain.
## Alliance
#### Rokkenjima

[[Characters/Kinzo\|Kinzo]]'s first child.

As the oldest of the four siblings, he leads the family conference. However, the other siblings think he is trying to get all of the inheritance for himself, and this further strains the tensions between them.

He is a real estate investor and has put a lot of money into the development of a resort. However, his results have been harshly criticized.

---
His corpse was found in a guest room deep within the mansion.  
About half of his head was destroyed. It’s probably reasonable to assume that he was murdered with a powerful gun or something similar.  

A [[Characters/The Seven Stakes of Purgatory\|demon stake]] was buried into the damaged area.  

No one can escape from [[Tips/The Chiester Golden Bows\|the Chiester's golden arrows]].
# Theories
Not much to say about him yet, other than he Knows [[Characters/Kinzo\|Kinzo]] is dead and wants to hide it because having to resolve

[[Occam's Razor\|Occam's Razor]] would say he's the most likely murderer of Kinzo. But we really can't picture him doing that.

> [!note]- Kinzo was murdered
> Kinzo died before the start of the game, and it's not by old age or illness, but he was attacked and killed.
> We're not saying Krauss did it because he wouldn't have the balls.
> 
> ---
> Leads:
> - It was confirmed that Kinzo is already dead before the game even starts.
> - It can be supposed that this means his death happened the same way in every scenario, but this must mean that every red truth about one of his deaths applies to his one true death.
> - Therefore, looking at the [[Mysteries/Episode 3 mysteries/Crime scenes of the 6 linked closed rooms\|6 linked closed rooms]] case tells us that:
> 	- Kinzo didn't die in a trap.
> 	- Kinzo died instantly after being attacked, suggesting a violent death.
> - His body is consistently (but not always, more on this later) found burned, perhaps as an attempt to hide a different cause of death.

Krauss is aware of the existence of this gold and has an ingot. It's unknown how he got hold of it while being unaware of where the rest is. It must either be a fake or have been placed by somebody.
