# Descriptions

## Legend
#### Rokkenjima

The [[Speculation/Golden Witch\|Golden Witch]], who has lived for a thousand years.

She has surpassed the limits of humans and, like demons, will sometimes appear in response to the summons made by humans, to offer her power in exchange for a price.

She likes black tea and ice cream. She hates boredom and people who deny her existence.

What a useless dream, to try and kill me despite being a mere human. Fire your bullets, and they will merely reflect back towards you like light off a mirror.

However, there does exist just one way to kill me. You hold that method in the palm of your hand. Though I doubt one as mediocre as you could ever pull it off.

Hihihihihihihihihihihi! Heheheheheheheheheheh!

The [[Speculation/Endless Witch\|Endless Witch]], who has lived for a thousand years. She holds the fatherly magical power that is the source of endless evolution in the sea.

However, that power is meaningless. No matter how many times you multiply something in the sea of 0, it will never be more than 0.

However, when she was blessed by a miracle that gave birth to 1 in that sea, her world became endless.

When she was joined with the [[Speculation/Witch of Origins\|Witch of Origins]] through [[Tips/Mariage Sorcière\|Mariage Sorcière]], their [[Tips/Magical Compendiums\|magical compendium]] gained an endless span, as well as endless power.

We shall call the Beato that shows up in Rokkenjima X Beato because she is non actually Beatrice and she is person X.

Known exclusively as the Golden with on the human side and exclusively as the Endless witch on the witch side.

It seems that simply getting Battler to say he gives up is not enough, he has to actually believe in witches for Beatrice to win.

Beato era un merdone senza Maria e mariage sorciere.
