# Descriptions

## Alliance
#### Future

Daughter of the declining noble family, Sumadera.
[[Characters/Kyrie\|Ushiromiya Kyrie]]’s younger sister.

She despises her sister, and by extension, [[Characters/Ange\|Ange]] as well.

She’s the opposite of the freewheeling person Kyrie once was and holds appearance in high regard, possessing a strong ambition for philanthropy. However, this is all just a craving for the limelight caused by the complex she has towards her sister.

There are several opposing factions in the Sumadera Family, and they’re constantly engaged in a secret feud over who will control the vast wealth Ange holds.

> [!tip]- Kasumi Sumadera is EVA Beatrice.
> If we absolutely must find her an identity among the known characters, it would have to be [[Characters/Kasumi\|Kasumi]].

> Leads:
> - > "Will she be able to overcome the trials that forced her predecessor to surrender?"
> 	- Kyrie could be said to have surrendered when faced with her family's trials.
> - She literally shows up layered over Kasumi  to represent the [[Speculation/Black Magic\|Black Witch]].
> - There was a big deal in Banquet about the cigarette Kyrie had in her pocket that didn't actually lead anywhere, and later on Kasumi is confirmed to be a smoker.
> 
> Cons:
> - It disqualifies her from being the future Eva we need for our [[Characters/Eva#Theories\|Eva#Theories]].
> - The black witch framework is applied to Rosa and Maria as well.
