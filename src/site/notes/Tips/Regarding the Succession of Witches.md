In the noble families of witches, family secrets are often inherited by a single child to prevent a propagation of hidden arts and a subsequent decline in their quality.

This rule applies for the [[Endless Witch\|Endless witches]], so their most secret arts are passed down to a single pupil, and once one has passed down these arts to another, they retire to further stem their propagation.

Custom dictates that a witch from another sect make a recommendation before a succession may occur.

[[Characters/Lambdadelta\|Lambdadelta]] recommended [[Characters/Eva\|EVA Beatrice]]. Bernkastel recommended [[Characters/Ange\|Ange Ushiromiya]]. It is unknown who recommended [[Characters/Beatrice\|Beato]].

Furthermore, during the story, Beatrice inherited that name along with the position, but that is a very recent innovation. The Predecessor was the original Beatrice, and all [[Endless Witch\|Endless Witch]]es before her had different names. After that, it became customary for the name to be inherited as well, and EVA followed that tradition when giving ANGE the name of Beatrice.
