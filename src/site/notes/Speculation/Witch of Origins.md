Maria's title, expanded upon in [[Tips/Regarding Creators\|Regarding Creators]] and [[Characters/Maria#Alliance\|Maria#Alliance#Tea Party]]

Maria often exhibits neurodivergent traits. This could be a justification for her extremely fervid imagination.
[[Characters/Beatrice\|Beatrice]] needed someone like Maria to expand her magical compendium. She is the one who populates the endless witch narrative with all sorts of quirky characters, from furniture to demons.

[[Characters/Sakutarou\|Sakutarou]] is the most obvious case, but another prime example are [[Characters/The Chiester Sisters Imperial Guard Corps\|the Chiester Sisters Imperial Guard Corps]], who are said to belong to Beatrice but actually originate from Maria.
