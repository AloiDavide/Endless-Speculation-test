# Descriptions

## Legend
#### Tea Party

The [[Speculation/Witch of the Fragments\|Witch of the Fragments]], who has lived a thousand years.

It is said she lives in a world where the concepts of fate and possibilities can be visualized. She observes the fate of humans and sometimes interferes.

In other words, sometimes she is you, and sometimes she is your only friend. ...Understand?

She likes wine and spicy foods. She hates boredom and people who never learn.

---
By constantly continuing to think, I will live forever. In other words, if I were to stop thinking, I could die at any time. However, once I start thinking again, I can also revive at any time.

That’s why I’m fickle and whimsical. I live as I please, die as I please, and revive as I please.
## Turn
#### Tea Party

The [[Speculation/Witch of Miracles\|Witch of Miracles]], who has lived for a thousand years.  
Her vast power is capable of creating all kinds of miracles, but her heart has broken a bit as a result.  

Back when she was a human, [[Characters/Lambdadelta\|Lambdadelta]] once imprisoned her within a cruel fate, toying with her the whole time. As a result, it seems she’s unable to abandon others who are caught within a similar fate.  

Theoretically, she’s a witch with the greatest of powers, but in practice, this is no more realistic than folding a piece of paper a hundred times so that it reaches the moon.  

Yet, she did fold it a hundred times.  
## Banquet
#### Tea Party

The [[Speculation/Witch of Miracles\|Witch of Miracles]], who has lived for a thousand years.
Her vast power is capable of creating all kinds of miracles, but her heart has broken a bit as a result.

Back when she was a human, [[Characters/Lambdadelta\|Lambdadelta]] once imprisoned her within a cruel fate, toying with her the whole time. As a result, it seems she's unable to abandon others who are caught within a similar fate.

Theoretically, she's a witch with the greatest of powers, but in practice, this is no more realistic than folding a piece of paper a hundred times so that it reaches the moon.

Yet, she did fold it a hundred times.
## Alliance
#### Tea Party

The [[Speculation/Witch of Miracles\|Witch of Miracles]], who has lived for a thousand years. To defeat [[Characters/Beatrice\|Beatrice]] in her game, she threw in a piece called [[Characters/Ange\|ANGE]].

The [[Tips/Regarding Voyagers\|Voyager]] witches who cross the [[sea of Fragments\|sea of Fragments]] are beings far superior to the witches who cannot leave their own territories.

While they may be on an even footing inside this territory, her true magical power far surpasses that of Beatrice.

What is sought by those witches who repeatedly voyage in an attempt to escape boredom...?
# Theories
What did it mean for her to add a piece to the board?
Will she go down to the actual Rokkenjima as Erika Furudo?

> [!note]- Bernkastel is a reader
> [[Characters/Bernkastel\|Bernkastel]] acts as an aid to the reader of Umineko and a reader herself. She represents the will to solve the mystery as a game (which makes her our patron witch).
> 
> ---
> Evidence:
> - She views this game as a cure for boredom.
> - We are 95% sure she writes the intro cards of each episode addressing the reader.
> - She talks to battler in the tea parties, but she's also clearly talking to the reader.
> - "Sometimes she is you, sometimes she is your best friend..."
> - Lots of Higurashi parallels that we won't get into.

> [!note]- Knowledge of the loops
> Every meta character who sees and references events from multiple episodes is somebody who is aware of the [[Mysteries/Bottled letters\|Bottled letters]] that have been found in the future.
> 
> This would include:
> - Sayo as Beatrice, Kanon and Shannon
> - X Beato as herself
> - Genji as himself and Ronove
> - Kumasawa as Virgilia
> - Ange (retroactively from the future)
> - EVA Beatrice (either retroactively or because she was there)
> - Possibly Nanjo?

> We notably can't make this claim about Kinzo and Maria.

> [!note]+ Kasumi Sumadera is EVA Beatrice.
> If we absolutely must find her an identity among the known characters, it would have to be [[Characters/Kasumi\|Kasumi]].
> 
> ---
> Leads:
> - Kyrie could be said to have surrendered when faced with her family's trials.
> - She does literally show up layered over Kasumi  to represent the [[Speculation/Black Magic\|Black Witch]].
> - There was a big deal in Banquet about the cigarette Kyrie had in her pocket that didn't actually lead anywhere, and later on Kasumi is confirmed to be a smoker.
> 
> Cons:
> - It disqualifies her from being the future Eva we need for [[Characters/Eva#Theories\|this]] theory.
> - The black witch framework is applied to Rosa and Maria as well.

If Bern represents the Reader, then Lambda is the author who will keep you hooked, never quite giving you enough of the solution to feel satisfied.
