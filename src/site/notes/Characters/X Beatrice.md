# Theories

Formerly known as student Beato (by us, who gaslit ourselves, into thinking that was a student costume or somethign and then were not able to stop calling her that) 

- She is the 19th person X on Rokkenjima, at least in turn and alliance, possibly in legend too, we aren't sure about banquet.
- She isn't Sayo.

During Turn, she is seen talking to:
- Kanon
- Shannon
- Rosa
- The other adults in the chapel before the murders
- Kinzo and Battler at the very end.

It's sort of possible she might be Sayo's sister, maybe even a twin, if a bunch of other theories are true.
- They do look fairly similar
- They have the same mark on opposite legs
- It helps us claim she can dress up as Shannon convincingly.

She is the one who hols regrets about Battler not remembering his sin in the tea party of Alliance
