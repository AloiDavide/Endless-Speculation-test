### Axioms
Banquet
- __Furthermore, all of the doors and windows on the six rooms are normal. No device exists which can lock them without a key, such as an auto lock.__
- __These six are all dead: [[Characters/Kinzo\|Kinzo]], [[Characters/Genji\|Genji]], [[Characters/Shannon\|Shannon]], [[Characters/Kanon\|Kanon]], [[Characters/Gohda\|Gohda]], [[Characters/Kumasawa\|Kumasawa]]!__
- __There is no one hiding in the six rooms!__
- __The six died instantly!__ By died instantly she means "The targets instantly became incapable of action after being attacked."
- ([[Characters/Ronove\|Ronove]])__Only the victims are inside the rooms, and no other people exist inside the rooms.__
- __The six were not killed by traps__!
---
Alliance
-  __All five master keys were discovered, each in the pocket of one of the servants! The individual room keys were found inside envelopes alongside the corpses! In short, all keys related to the linked closed rooms were locked inside the linked closed rooms!! No key could have been returned from outside the room using the crack of the door, the crack of the window, vents or any place of the sort!!__
- __All of them had what appeared to be gunshot wounds that were fatal! Murdering them from outside the room would have been impossible!! I shall say more with the red! When the five other than Kinzo were killed, the killer was definitely in the same room as them! I already proclaimed in red at the time that there were no suicides!!__

### Corollaries
- All the rooms where (at least) a servant with (at least) a key has been found, are linked closed rooms.

- Even if we suppose __"the linked closed rooms"__ only include five rooms out of the six, and we collapse Shannon and Kanon into Sayo, she still must have died in one of the 5 rooms.


If there is a way of dying that is neither a trap or accident, nor a murder nor a suicide, it would solve both this and the [[Mysteries/Episode 1 mysteries/Kanon's death in the boiler room\|boiler room]] in Legend


A 7th dead person solves it. They are close to Sayo pretending to be dead.

"The linked closed rooms" might be the name of the mistery and not a property of the rooms

The word "corpse" might be flexible.
It's very convenient for them to still be alive after this, but it requires bending the red just enough to raise brows.
