As a witch, [[Characters/Beatrice\|Beatrice]] holds two titles: "[[Speculation/Golden Witch\|Golden]]" and "[[Speculation/Endless Witch\|Endless]]".
These originally came from separate [[Tips/Magical Compendiums\|Magical Compendiums]], so it can be said she weilds the power of two compendiums.

The title of [[Speculation/Endless Witch\|Endless Witch]] has its fundation in "Endless Creation" and is the root of her unmatched, eldless magical power.
The title of [[Speculation/Golden Witch\|Golden Witch]] has its fundation in "the Realization of Magic", a magical power that can materialize imaginary precious metals, providing the miracle of manifestation to all less tangible forms of magic.

These two titles were refined even further with [[Tips/Mariage Sorcière\|Mariage Sorcière]] leading to their sublimation into the compendium known as "[[Speculation/Endless Realization\|Endless Realization]]".

In that sense, she technically shouldn't be referred as either the Endless Witch or the Golden Witch, but by a new title that is a fusion of the two.

Even to this day the modern incarnation of beatrice is supporting this claim and identifying with the image and narrative Kinzo has created because it's a valuable addition to her own narrative ([[Speculation/Endless Realization\|Endless Realization]]).

> [!note]- Endless magic is a folk tale
> The origin of the [[Speculation/Endless Witch\|endless magic]] narrative is a kind of folklore passed down in [[Characters/Kumasawa\|Kumasawa]]'s family. It pre-dates [[Characters/Kinzo\|Kinzo]]'s golden witch narrative and it could have been a source of inspiration for him, or maybe the two concepts were separate until they were merged by [[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]], who was raised in part by both of them.

Maybe "gaining endless power" means entering the public consciousness, and the rokkenjima case was instrumental for that to happen with [[Characters/Beatrice\|Beatrice]].
