# Descriptions

## Legend
#### Rokkenjima

[[Characters/Krauss\|Krauss]] and [[Characters/Natsuhi\|Natsuhi]]’s daughter.

In the absence of any irregularities, it is thought that she will eventually inherit the headship of the Ushiromiya family (or technically, her husband will). However, she seems to have no interest in all of this.

She was born with weak bronchi and is sometimes assailed by sudden asthma attacks.

---
Missing.

Even though she was given a precious invitation to the [[Speculation/Golden Land\|Golden Land]], a single fool refused to believe in the witch, and all of the magic disappeared.

She was then chewed to bits by demons and went to hell.
## Turn
#### Rokkenjima

[[Characters/Krauss\|Krauss]] and [[Characters/Natsuhi\|Natsuhi]]’s daughter.

In the absence of any irregularities, it is thought that she will eventually inherit the headship of the Ushiromiya family (or technically, her husband will). However, she seems to have no interest in all of this.

She was born with weak bronchi and is sometimes assailed by sudden asthma attacks.

---
Found in [[Mysteries/Jessica's Room\|her own room]] in the mansion with a weapon shaped like a [[Characters/The Seven Stakes of Purgatory\|stake]] rammed into her back.  

Finally, at the very end, she got to be with the person she loved.  
She must have been happy.
## Banquet
#### Rokkenjima

[[Characters/Krauss\|Krauss]] and [[Characters/Natsuhi\|Natsuhi]]’s daughter.

In the absence of any irregularities, it is thought that she will eventually inherit the headship of the Ushiromiya family (or technically, her husband will). However, she seems to have no interest in all of this.

She was born with weak bronchi and is sometimes assailed by sudden asthma attacks.

---
Missing.  

She certainly was joined with [[Characters/Kanon\|Kanon]] in the [[Speculation/Golden Land\|Golden Land]]. They both apologized for their own cowardice, communicating their true and honest feelings. And, they hugged each other until their final moments.  

Afterwards, she was chewed to pieces by demons and went to hell.  
It's all right. Kanon is with her.
## Alliance
#### Rokkenjima

[[Characters/Krauss\|Krauss]] and [[Characters/Natsuhi\|Natsuhi]]’s daughter.

In the absence of any irregularities, it is thought that she will eventually inherit the headship of the Ushiromiya family (or technically, her husband will). However, she seems to have no interest in all of this.

She was born with weak bronchi and is sometimes assailed by sudden asthma attacks.

---
Her corpse was found in [[Mysteries/Jessica's Room\|her room]] on the second floor of the mansion.  
About half of her head was destroyed. It's probably reasonable to assume that she was murdered with a [[powerful gun\|powerful gun]] or something similar.  

She was smashed by her own attack due to George’s counter-offensive specialized barrier.
# Theories

If Sayo doesn't end up being a thing she is the only other candidate for Maria's Beatrice, but there was never a good reason to suspect her for anything. The only times she shows up in the red is to tell us she's either dead or innocent.

Crunter really hopes the solution to some closed room is Jessica dying to her asthma, this is a [[Chekhov's Gun\|Chekhov's Gun]] moment.
