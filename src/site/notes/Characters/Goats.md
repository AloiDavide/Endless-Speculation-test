# Descriptions

## Banquet
#### Tea Party

Low-level furniture in service to [[Characters/Beatrice\|Beatrice]].
They are great in number, but silent and lacking personality. They obediently follow their master's orders.

Their senses are closer to those of animals than humans, and they're surprisingly dull-witted, which sometimes leads them to misunderstand their orders.
They have by nature a massive build like a minotaur's and fearsome superhuman strength.

They may be low-level furniture, but the ability to summon an inexhaustible supply of them makes them extremely convenient.
