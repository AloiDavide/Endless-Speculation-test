# Descriptions

## Legend
#### Rokkenjima

[[Characters/Kinzo\|Kinzo]]’s attending physician and long-time friend.

He once ran a hospital on Niijima, but he turned it over to his son and now enjoys his old age in peace.

Now that Kinzo’s constant suspicion has reached extraordinary heights, Nanjo is one of the very few people he trusts. Thanks to Nanjo’s big-hearted nature, he has been able to continue his friendship with Kinzo despite the latter’s tendency to fly into a rage at the slightest provocation.

---
Found in the [[Mysteries/Episode 1 mysteries/Servants deaths in the parlor\|parlor]]. His thigh had a weapon resembling an [[Characters/The Seven Stakes of Purgatory\|icepick]] sticking out of it, and his face had been smashed.

At the seventh twilight, gouge the knee and kill.
## Turn
#### Rokkenjima

[[Characters/Kinzo\|Kinzo]]’s attending physician and long-time friend.

He once ran a hospital on Niijima, but he turned it over to his son and now enjoys his old age in peace.

Now that Kinzo’s constant suspicion has reached extraordinary heights, Nanjo is one of the very few people he trusts. Thanks to Nanjo’s big-hearted nature, he has been able to continue his friendship with Kinzo despite the latter’s tendency to fly into a rage at the slightest provocation.

---
Died in the [[Mysteries/Servant Room\|Servant Room]], his throat sliced open by a sharp blade or something similar.  

However, this alone isn't enough.

---
His corpse, which had gone missing, was later found in the courtyard.  
At that time, it had a weapon shaped like a [[Characters/The Seven Stakes of Purgatory\|stake]] rammed into its knee.  

With this, the seventh twilight is finished.
## Banquet
#### Rokkenjima

[[Characters/Kinzo\|Kinzo]]’s attending physician and long-time friend.

He once ran a hospital on Niijima, but he turned it over to his son and now enjoys his old age in peace.

Now that Kinzo’s constant suspicion has reached extraordinary heights, Nanjo is one of the very few people he trusts. Thanks to Nanjo’s big-hearted nature, he has been able to continue his friendship with Kinzo despite the latter’s tendency to fly into a rage at the slightest provocation.

---
His corpse was found in the hallway in front of the mansion's [[Mysteries/Servant Room\|Servant Room]].  
The weapon used on him is assumed to be a [[Characters/The Chiester Sisters Imperial Guard Corps\|gun]] or spear-shaped object.  

Just a little longer, and he'd probably have managed to return alive. However, in the very end, the witch did not permit that.
## Alliance
#### Rokkenjima

[[Characters/Kinzo\|Kinzo]]’s attending physician and long-time friend.

He once ran a hospital on Niijima, but he turned it over to his son and now enjoys his old age in peace.

---
His corpse was found behind the mansion.  
About half of his head was destroyed. It's probably reasonable to assume that he was murdered with a [[Characters/The Chiester Sisters Imperial Guard Corps\|powerful gun]] or something similar.  

A [[Characters/The Seven Stakes of Purgatory\|demon stake]] had fallen near the body.

> [!note]- Gaap is the meta counterpart of Nanjo
> Yes, we're serious.
> Look there aren't many options left. It has to be someone involved with Sayo. If it's not [[Characters/Nanjo\|Nanjo]] we're left with just about [[Characters/Kawabata\|Kawabata]].
>
>She is really good at creating closed rooms just like Nanjo when he lies about someone being dead.

>We believe in Gaanjo.

> Leads:
> - Genji would do anything related to Kinzo's will. Or alternatively he's following Sayo as his new master after Kinzo died because he sees her, Beatrice, as the true heir.
> - Nanjo wants money for his sick grand daughter and Ange shows us that's exactly what his family received.
> - Kumasawa's family also got the money, and she has a personal attachment to Sayo.
> - Gohda will comply if threatened, he probably isn't even in on the plan from the start.
> - This is probably circular evidence, but Ronove Viriglia and Gaap are shown taking orders from Beatrice, implying a relationship of servitude.
