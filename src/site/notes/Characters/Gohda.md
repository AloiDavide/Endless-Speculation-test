---
His corpse was found inside the [[Mysteries/Episode 1 mysteries/Rose garden storehouse\|Rose garden storehouse]]. His face seems to have been smashed after his death.

---
Died in [[Mysteries/Natsuhi's room\|Natsuhi's room]], with his chest pierced by a weapon shaped like [[Characters/The Seven Stakes of Purgatory\|stake]].

Kihihihihi.

It's assumed that he was hung by the neck after being shot in the forehead.  

They put ropes around their own necks.  
That can be a pretty interesting experience now and then. 
# Theories


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



> [!note]- Gohda is just a cook who happened to be there
> Poor [[Characters/Gohda\|Gohda]] was just dragged into all this mess and is doing his best to survive.
> When he doesn't die immediately he's being threatened by the other servants and doing a poor job of hiding it.

> ---
> Leads:
> - In both [[Episodes/Turn of the Golden witch\|turn]] and [[Episodes/Alliance of the Golden witch\|alliance]] he has to lie and say he saw a magical scene, but he sucks at it and can't say anything coherent.
> - He's even used as a test subject. [[Tips/Notes from a Certain Chef\|Notes from a Certain Chef]] is about the other servants testing their ability to scare people using the witch stories before the real event.
