## Axioms
- __All of the survivors have alibis! Let us include the dead as well!! In short, no kind of human or dead person on the island could have killed [[Characters/Kanon\|Kanon]]!__
- __Kanon did not commit suicide__
- Beatrice refuses to repeat that it was a homicide.
- __Kanon did not die in an accident__!


##### An interesting piece of narration about the boiler room
> It isn't clear when Grandfather's corpse started burning in the incinerator. Since, according to Genji, the strength of the flames hadn't been that strong, the body must have started burning a long time ago, so that stench could slowly creep out of the furnace and fill the room bit by bit, eventually pouring out and climbing up the staircase. Putting aside whether he was rare or well-done, Grandfather had been brought out, killed, and burned... even though he had started out locked away in the closed room created by his auto-lock. There's probably no doubting this...  
>   
> However, according to Genji-san, the boiler room is usually locked. The possibility that someone outside our group had snuck in and committed the crime was overwhelmingly high, and there was also a good chance that this person was walking around with something like a master key. After all, the doors and windows throughout the mansion had been checked. But despite that, the culprit was able to strut around the mansion freely.


## Corollaries
- The first red basically translates to "it was not a homicide", unless the perpetrator is not technically a survivor, or is not a person on the island.
 What about the closing door Kumasawa and Kanon heard from the basement?
- Just like with the murder in [[Mysteries/Episode 1 mysteries/Eva and Hideyoshi's room\|Eva and Hideyoshi's room]], we can't trust the unreliable narration to accurately describe a scene with only the servants present.
"According to Genji-san the boiler room is usually locked."
- Nothing according to Genji is reliable.
"After all, the doors and windows throughout the mansion had been checked."
- By the servants and Natsuhi. We think Natsuhi is innocent but they might have split up.

SUPER obsolete theory from before we ironed out the details of our Sayo conjecture, and Kanon was still a separate person.
> [!failure]- Kanon wasn't in Rokkenjima
> Shannon survived the first twilight. She took on Kanon's identity who by that point was no longer in Rokkenjima, and was the person killed in the boiler room.

> Pros:
> - We can claim that Kanon left the island and was killed by someone, or he's was never on the island at all and survived.
> - We get down to 16 people and can have a culprit X for all the murders.
> 
> Cons:
> - What happened to __No one else can go by Kanon's name!__ ? (we actually had kind of a work around but it was a stretch).
> - Nanjo is still lying in this theory, he wouldn't mistake one for the other while examining the body.
> - If we claim Kanon is already dead like Kinzo this needs to hold for every episode, but it at least is definitely false in Alliance.
> - "No one escapes, all die." Gets in the way of him leaving the island after being there.
