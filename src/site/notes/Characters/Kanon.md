# Descriptions

## Legend
#### Rokkenjima

A young servant.

He performs his duties silently and diligently, but is not so highly regarded as a servant due to his unsociable nature.

There are multiple other servants with the “on” (音) character in their pseudonyms. He and [[Characters/Shannon\|Shannon]] just happened to be the ones on duty that day.

---
Found in the [[Mysteries/Episode 1 mysteries/Kanon's death in the boiler room\|boiler room]] with a weapon resembling an [[Characters/The Seven Stakes of Purgatory\|icepick]] sticking out of his chest.

How presumptuous of lowly furniture like that.
## Turn
#### Rokkenjima

A young servant.

He performs his duties silently and diligently, but is not so highly regarded as a servant due to his unsociable nature.

There are multiple other servants with the “on” (音) character in their pseudonyms. He and [[Characters/Shannon\|Shannon]] just happened to be the ones on duty that day.

---
The witch erased his corpse for fun.  
That alone caused an incredible uneasiness among the survivors.  

If that which exists resides in the human world, then that which does not exist is truly fantasy.  

Fantasy takes the form of what they fear.

---
There's no corpse. And yet, he's dead.  

The witch said so in red.  
So, he definitely is dead, even though there's no corpse.
#### Tea Party

So far, he is the last furniture created by [[Characters/Kinzo\|Kinzo]].  

Making use of all his previous experience, Kinzo managed to implement a set of flawless specs.  
Kanon was also given a heart, but it was much weaker than Shannon's.  

Perhaps because Kinzo felt a sense of approaching personal danger related to his fortune as he neared the end of his life, he bestowed Kanon with the rare power to fight and protect.  

However, he hasn’t yet matured very far and is unable to properly control his own power and speed.
## Banquet
#### Rokkenjima

A young servant.

He performs his duties silently and diligently, but is not so highly regarded as a servant due to his unsociable nature.

There are multiple other servants with the “on” (音) character in their pseudonyms. He and [[Characters/Shannon\|Shannon]] just happened to be the ones on duty that day.

---
His corpse was found in the [[Mysteries/Episode 2 mysteries/Crime scene in the chapel\|Chapel]].  
The weapon used on him is assumed to be a [[Characters/The Chiester Sisters Imperial Guard Corps\|gun]] or spear-shaped object.

For Kanon, the chapel. Let him continue to protect the Lord's precious place, even after death.
## Alliance
#### Rokkenjima

A young servant.

He performs his duties silently and diligently, but is not so highly regarded as a servant due to his unsociable nature.

There are multiple other servants with the “on” (音) character in their pseudonyms. He and [[Characters/Shannon\|Shannon]] just happened to be the ones on duty that day.

---
Battler was not able to find his corpse.  

No matter how he’s killed with magic, without a corpse, he’s a definite suspect.  
Now that’s definitely anti-fantasy.  

<font color="#ff0000">Therefore, I guarantee his death with the red truth.  </font>

Now that’s definitely anti-mystery...! 
# Theories
Refer to [[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]] and [[Long Form Theories/Theory for Legend of the Golden witch#Part 2 The Sayo Conjecture\|The Sayo Conjecture]]



__No one else can go by Kanon's name! A different person can't claim that as their name!__

> [!note]- Kanon showed up around 3 to 5 years ago.
> - He has been around longer than [[Characters/Gohda\|Gohda]], so at least two years.
> - He was present during the flashback in [[Episodes/Turn of the Golden witch\|turn]] which takes place with [[Characters/Shannon\|Shannon]] in middle school and [[Characters/George\|George]] only barely an adult.
> - He is the second furniture "made" by [[Characters/Kinzo\|Kinzo]]  after Shannon.
> - Battler didn't know him, so that puts the limit at 6 years.

> [!note]- Kanon did not die in the boiler room... at all!
> No need to assume he died in the [[Mysteries/Episode 1 mysteries/Kanon's death in the boiler room\|boiler room]] in legend, they could just as easily have faked it.

> ---
> Leads:
> - Kanon supposedly pulls out the stake from his chest before being found.
> - They had plenty of fake blood to make the magic circles.
> - Beatrice refuses to repeat that it was a homicide.
> - We already think Nanjo is lying.
> - We couldn't figure out another way around the red.
> ---
> Obstacles:
> - Jessica supposedly witnessed his death because she was taking care of him the whole time, but she also would have believed the doctor in the room when he declares someone dead.
