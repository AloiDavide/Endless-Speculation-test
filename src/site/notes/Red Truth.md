Let's begin our comprehensive account of every red truth in the question arcs... with a blue truth.


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



> [!note]- The red truths are true
> Anything anybody says in red is definitely true. You need to factor in the context it's said in, and there's some leeway due to ambiguity, but if you try to say a false statement you won't be able to finish the sentence, implying the existence of an absolute truth.
> 
> - Why doesn't Battler use this to his advantage to try and repeat his own theories?
> 	- It's either an unspoken rule, or he can only use red truths when given permission by the witch side.
> - For some red truths, it's ambiguous if they hold in general for every episode or not. In those cases we reserve the right to pick what's more convenient. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ 
> - It's also ok to say things in red that have no bearing on the truth of things, such as cackling witch noises and inconsequential taunts.

## Crime Scene of the [[Mysteries/Chapel\|Chapel]]
- __When I speak the truth, I will use red__
- __Regardless of whether they were alive or dead, the six definitely entered trough the door__!
- __Only one key to the chapel exists__!
- __It is impossible to unlock the lock to the chapel with anything but the chapel's key__!!
- __When the door to the chapel is locked, it prevents any and all methods of entry or exit__!!
- __The six definitely entered trough 'this front door'__!!
- __This morning [[Characters/Rosa\|Rosa]] definitely took an envelope out of [[Characters/Maria\|Maria]]'s handbag... and from that obtained the genuine key to the chapel__.
- __The key to the chapel truly was the object inside the envelope I gave Maria__.
- __The envelope I handed over to Maria and the one Rosa opened are the same thing__!!

## Crime Scene of [[Mysteries/Jessica's Room\|Jessica's Room]]
- __The only master keys are the ones held by the servants, one key each__.
- __There are absolutely no types of hidden doors. This door is the only way in or out__. __The only way to lock this door is with Jessica's single key or the master keys, only one of which is held by each servant__. It is on the second floor, but it is probably possible to enter or leave trough the window. However, __the window is locked from the inside__.
- __[[Characters/Kanon\|Kanon]] was killed in this room__.
- Of course, this door is the same as the chapel. __When locked, it does not permit any form of entry__. I'll say more. __No trick could have the effect of locking the door from the outside without using a key__.
## Crime Scene of the [[Mysteries/Servant Room\|Servant Room]]
- (In the character description of Kanon) __Therefore, I guarantee his death with the red truth.__
- __There are no hidden doors in this room__. __There is no way to get in or out other then the door and the windows__.
[[Characters/Beatrice\|Beato]] defines hidden door. "A hidden door refers to an entrance that cannot be recognized by those who do not know of it. Even children knows that."
- '__There are no hidden doors__'
- What about the original key to this room, the 'keys to the servants' room'?!
  Indeed. Those are __kept in the key box in the center of the servant room__. There are several servant room keys, but  __all of those are inside the key box__.
- __Entry and exit are impossible except for the single door and the single window__.
- __And those were both locked__. __The door and the window do not permit any kind of entry or exit when they are locked__.
- __It is impossible to unlock the door without a servant room key or the master key__.
- __No one exists in this room except your group__. __'Your group' refers to [[Characters/Battler\|Battler]], [[Characters/George\|George]], [[Characters/Maria\|Maria]], [[Characters/Rosa\|Rosa]], [[Characters/Genji\|Genji]], [[Characters/Gohda\|Gohda]], and [[Characters/Shannon\|Shannon]]__.
- Let's go back to Jessica's room. __When Jessica's corpse was discovered, only Battler, George, Maria, Rosa, Genji, Gohda, Shannon, [[Characters/Kumasawa\|Kumasawa]], and [[Characters/Nanjo\|Nanjo]] were in Jessica's room__. Whoops, the corpse of __[[Characters/Jessica\|Jessica]] is also included__. __Therefore, both in the case involving Jessica's room and the one involving this servant room, no humans exist that you were not aware of__. __No one is hiding__.
- __No method exists by which the door can be locked from the outside without using a key__. __Regarding the window, no method exists by which it could somehow be locked from the outside__.
- __You are incompetent__!
- __hiiihhhihihhihihihihihihihihihihi__!!
- __Come, Ushiromiya Battler, and kneel__.
- __If you accept me, all of the riddles will be resolved__. __With my power, any kind of closed room can be created or destroyed__!!
- __I'll make you my favourite furniture__. __I'll love you so much and make you my toy untill you turn into ashes__...
- __* cackle * cackle * cackle * hihihihihihihihihihihyahyahahhahahahahhahahahhahhahhahhahhahhahha__!!!
- __There are only five master keys__. __There are only five master keys__.
- __I keep my promises__ If you solve the riddle of the epitaph, you should be able to reach the [[Speculation/Golden Land\|Golden Land]]. When you do, the ceremony will end. No more people will die.

## Crime Scene of [[Mysteries/Natsuhi's room\|Natsuhi's room]]
- __Natsuhi's room was exactly the same just like usual__! __The door and windows were locked from the inside__. __There were no frauds or tricks, no means of secret passage nor places in which to hide__! __[[Characters/Natsuhi\|Natsuhi]]'s own keys was in [[Characters/George\|George]]'s pocket, and the inside of the room was sealed off__. __Only the five master keys were left, and 'Rosa' was holding all of them__! __and let me say this: the parlor's the same__. __The key to the parlor itself is sealed away in the servant's room__. __So unlocking it without a master key is impossible! The definition of a closed room remains the same as always!__
