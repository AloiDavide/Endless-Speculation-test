> [!note]+ Knowledge of the loops
> Every meta character who sees and references events from multiple episodes is somebody who is aware of the bottled letters in reality.
> 
> This would include:
> - Sayo as Beatrice, Kanon and Shannon
> - X Beato as herself
> - Genji as himself and Ronove
> - Kumasawa as Virgilia
> - Ange (retroactively from the future)
> - EVA Beatrice (either retroactively or because she was there)
> - Possibly Nanjo?
> 
> We notably can't make this claim about Kinzo and Maria.
{ #592946}


> [!note]+ The cast isn't fixed.
> The starting conditions of each episode are not fixed. In particular, different people can be on rokkenjima in one episode and not in the next. Such as [[Characters/X Beatrice\|X Beatrice]] and [[Characters/EVA Beatrice\|EVA Beatrice]].

> Leads:
> - There is a rule according to [[Characters/Bernkastel\|Bernkastel]] that makes this game like a maze that's always shifting.
> - According to [[Characters/Lambdadelta\|Lambdadelta]] beatrice "Will do things like take worthless pieces and place excess pieces on the board to make things more one-sided."
> - It follows nicely from all the episodes also being written tales inside the bottles.
> ---
> Obstacles:
> - Bern was unable to physically insert Ange in Rokkenjima, as there is no possible world where she didn't stay home, but this might just be a consequence of her powers being fundamentally different from those of [[Characters/Beatrice\|Beatrice]].

> [!note]+ Each portrait is a new character.
> Each time a new portrait is shown, it means a new piece has joined the chessboard of Rokkenjima.
> 
> ---
> Leads:
> - It fits with both cases shown so far.
> - It also fits our expectations of [[Erika Furudo\|Erika Furudo]].
> ---
> Obstacles:
> - Alliance didn't have a new portrait and [[Characters/X Beatrice\|X Beatrice]] was very definitely present in it. This would suggest that once you join you're there for good, but in that case why haven't we seen [[Characters/EVA Beatrice\|EVA Beatrice]] again?
