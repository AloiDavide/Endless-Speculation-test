## Axioms
- __There are no hidden doors in this room__. 
- __There is no way to get in or out other then the door and the windows__.
- '__There are no hidden doors__'
- What about the original key to this room, the 'keys to the servants' room'?!
  Indeed. Those are __kept in the key box in the center of the servant room__. There are several servant room keys, but  __all of those are inside the key box__.
- __Entry and exit are impossible except for the single door and the single window__.
- __And those were both locked__. __The door and the window do not permit any kind of entry or exit when they are locked__.
- __It is impossible to unlock the door without a servant room key or the master key__.
- __No one exists in this room except your group__. __'Your group' refers to [[Characters/Battler\|Battler]], [[Characters/George\|George]], [[Characters/Maria\|Maria]], [[Characters/Rosa\|Rosa]], [[Characters/Genji\|Genji]], [[Characters/Gohda\|Gohda]], and [[Characters/Shannon\|Shannon]]__.
- __There are only five master keys__. __There are only five master keys__.
- __I keep my promises__ If you solve the riddle of the epitaph, you should be able to reach the Golden Land. When you do, the ceremony will end. No more people will die.
- __They would never mistakenly think any other person was Kanon!__
- __No one else can go by Kanon's name! A different person can't claim that as their name!__

> [!note]- The scene in the servant room is false retelling
> There was no zombie Kanon. Kumasawa and Nanjo are killed by Genji and whoever is Shannon at the moment and the bodies are carried away. Then Gohda is threatened so that he has to play along with the absurd story. Rosa knows it's fake too, her job is just to make accusations and separate the group.

> [!note]- The scene in the servant room is an elaborate staging
> This is the version where we assume Kanon was there. In that case it was Sayo as Kanon, X as Shannon and everyone else except Gohda staging a shocking scene for the sake of it. Nanjo and Kumasawa are not actually dead and are killed later during the murders in Natsuhi's room.
> 
> What made it extra shocking and hard to talk about for Gohda was Kanon and Shannon suddenly being in the same room even though he knows they're supposed to be the same person.
