# Theories

Formerly known as student Beato (by us, who gaslit ourselves, into thinking that was a student costume or somethign and then were not able to stop calling her that) 

She is the 19th person X on Rokkenjima, at least in turn and alliance.

> The supposed corpse of Shannon isn't hers and it also isn't a corpse. That is simply [[Characters/X Beatrice\|X Beatrice]] trying to hide herself with the help of the adults.

> - Her presence isn't required for any Legend solution, and her being here would break an interesting pattern with the episodes.
