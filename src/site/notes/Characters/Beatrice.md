# Descriptions

## Legend
#### Rokkenjima

The [[Speculation/Golden Witch\|Golden Witch]], who has lived for a thousand years.

She has surpassed the limits of humans and, like demons, will sometimes appear in response to the summons made by humans, to offer her power in exchange for a price.

She likes black tea and ice cream. She hates boredom and people who deny her existence.

---
What a useless dream, to try and kill me despite being a mere human. Fire your bullets, and they will merely reflect back towards you like light off a mirror.

However, there does exist just one way to kill me. You hold that method in the palm of your hand. Though I doubt one as mediocre as you could ever pull it off.

Hihihihihihihihihihihi! Heheheheheheheheheheh!

The [[Speculation/Endless Witch\|Endless Witch]], who has lived for a thousand years. She holds the fatherly magical power that is the source of endless evolution in the sea.

However, that power is meaningless. No matter how many times you multiply something in the sea of 0, it will never be more than 0.

However, when she was blessed by a miracle that gave birth to 1 in that sea, her world became endless.

When she was joined with the [[Speculation/Witch of Origins\|Witch of Origins]] through [[Tips/Mariage Sorcière\|Mariage Sorcière]], their [[Tips/Magical Compendiums\|magical compendium]] gained an endless span, as well as endless power.

Explicitely for the sake of Battler (see the phone calls in Alliance) and maybe for Maria, who at certain points are the only people to be both alive and not in on the plan. This directly parallels the existence of a meta Beatrice fighting Battler in a battle of deduction.
> - Sayo is the only known person who could have interacted with Maria in Rokkenjima on repeated occasions to create [[Tips/Mariage Sorcière\|Mariage Sorcière]]. For the same reason it's very easy for her to give Maria the letters. She can claim to be Beatrice without needing a disguise.

It seems that simply getting Battler to say he gives up is not enough, he has to actually believe in witches for Beatrice to win.
