## Axioms
- __Natsuhi's death was a homicide! There were no unidentified corpses, and all of the survivors have alibis!__
- __The bullet buried into Natsuhi's forehead was not fired from her gun!__
- __The thing that shot Natsuhi wasn't a trap, it was a real shooting murder with a gun raised and trigger pulled!__

## Corollaries

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



> [!note]- Natsuhi's death in Legend
> She was shot by [[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]], who is still alive unbeknownst to us. Both the Shannon and Kanon deaths were faked using tricks that don't involve the use of unidentified corpses.
> 
> ---
> Leads:
> - The reds seemingly contradict each other, especially after we learn the culprit was present in the same room (thanks [[Characters/Lambdadelta\|Lambdadelta]]!), so something has to give, and  __There were no unidentified corpses, and all of the survivors have alibis!__ is the only part with some wiggle room.
> -  We are forced to restrict the definition of survivors to include only the people we are aware of at that moment, and not any other potentially alive person on the island. 
> - The unidentifies corpses part only rules out some tricks, but it's still possible to lie about someone's death without showing the corpse.
> - We know from later episodes that there are multiple winchesters.

Obsolete theory:

> [!failure]- Natsuhi is replaced in Legend
> [[Characters/Natsuhi\|Natsuhi]] was shot at some point previously, maybe during the murder of the first twilight, and from that point forward somebody else impersonates her. At the end her actual corpse is taken out
>

> Leads:
> - It explains why she would run away from the parlor.
> - It solves the red with no extra people at the end.
> 
> ---
> Obstacles:
> - We ran out of possible candidates.
> - If our culprit X is Natsuhi who is always with battler at the end, who's killing people?
> - Convincingly passing as somebody else is quite hard when you think about it, you would need a lot of practice.
