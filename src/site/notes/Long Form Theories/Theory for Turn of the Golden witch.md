Welcome to the second part of our Umineko theory. A quick refresher of the main points from Legend of the golden witch is available in the [[Theories TLDR\|theories TLDR]].

Turn of the golden witch is a lot more dense with information, but we'll hopefully make it easy to comprehend our thought process at every step of the way.

A few words on our modus operandi. After we outline what we agree to be the main points of each theory (our "blue truth" if you will), Crunter writes down the theory and Hound takes care of the editing phase where he adds his thoughts and opinions and handles the technical side of the project.

There might be parts in which we helped each other here and there, and others where we don't 100% agree on some position. 
In general, when we speak using the plural "we" it's our shared position, <font color="#00b050">when I (Crunter) speak in green it's my position</font>, and <font color="#ffdd33">when I (Hound) speak in yellow it's mine</font>.
If any witches dare to claim those colors in the answer arcs they WILL hear from our lawyers.

## Part 1: A very unfortunate triangle
<center>Poor George got the short end of the stick</center>


#### 1.1

The prologue of Turn opens on [[Characters/Shannon\|Shannon]] (who is, obviously, [[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]], given that she reveals the name herself) and [[Characters/George\|George]] going on a date at an aquarium in Okinawa. This is apparently their first vacation together. It's apparent to us that there is something sketchy with this date. [[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]]'s dialogue and general attitude makes it seem like she's not fully into what's happening.

![Pasted image 20250527175752.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250527175752.png)
<center>An example of the general vibe, Shannon is being evasive about her and George being close</center>

There are a few possible explanations. 
Maybe she likes him but she is struggling with emotions related to feeling inadequate and/or also having feelings for another person (as we'll explore in a bit).
Maybe she really doesn't like [[Characters/George\|George]] (as we'll also explore in a bit), either because she doesn't like the direction in which their relationship is going or because she's using that relationship as a stepping stone to achieve her goals.
It's possible some mix of these is on the table.
Could it be that she is just being shy according to anime tropes? Well it's not *impossible*, but given the weight this character has in our theories we can't make that assumption.

She insists on magic being what granted them the miracle of their relationship, and she remarks that [[Characters/Kanon\|Kanon]] doesn't believe in this magic, in the ability to see a blue sky even when it's cloudy. 
As established, magic in Umineko is mostly about interpretation. The symbolism speaks for itself, doesn't it? She's looking at a grey sky and calling it blue, because that's what she desperately wants.
But to us, [[Characters/Kanon\|Kanon]] not being on board suggests that a part of herself isn't on board with her "magical" narrative.

Let's say that [[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]], for some reason, is really invested in the fantasy of being in a relationship with [[Characters/George\|George]], and even if this isn't working out, she's conflicted about this because she worked really hard on it and it is what she wished for a long time.

---
#### 1.2

We're on the small shrine that is supposedly struck by lightning during the 2 days on Rokkenjima. 
We see someone, probably [[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]], smashing the mirror in the shrine. It's worth noting that she never mentions [[Characters/George\|George]] or anything like that, she talks about becoming a person, discovering love and the suffering that comes from it. 

For example, she could be talking about how after breaking out of some sort of metaphorical shell, she opens herself to love, but she realizes that she likes [[Characters/Jessica\|Jessica]] instead of [[Characters/George\|George]], and that comes with a whole baggage of internalized homophobia, especially if she was raised around [[Characters/Kinzo\|Kinzo]] and his, mmmh, well, let's say less then optimal view of gendered expectations and traditional family values.

She breaks the mirror, and says it's now Beatrice's turn to keep her promise. This marks her buying her own magical narrative angle.

![Pasted image 20250622122033.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250622122033.png)
[[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]] says that she is being tempted by the witch. This definitely won't be the last time that an evil witch is used to represent and justify the despicable deeds of a character within the context of the [[Characters/Beatrice\|Beatrice]] narrative.

Importantly, the scene opens with "It wouldn't let me forget the memories of the day when my old fate was broken and smashed.". We're sure this is important but we can't nail down what event she's referring to exactly.

![Pasted image 20250622123129.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250622123129.png)
Also importantly, someone told her about the motorboat she uses, maybe at this point she is already somewhat involved with her future plan, given that the only motorboat we know of near Rokkenjima is owned by captain [[Characters/Kawabata\|Kawabata]].

---
#### 1.3
We jump back in the timeline to a previous family conference, an unspecified amount of time before the one central to the story. 
We're probably talking about something like 3 or 4 years ago, since [[Characters/Shannon\|Shannon]] is in middle School and [[Characters/George\|George]] is Barely an adult (Yikes). 

![Pasted image 20250622123835.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250622123835.png)
We learn that [[Characters/George\|George]] has been looked after by [[Characters/Okonogi\|Okonogi]], which could lead us to theorize that [[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]] is courting [[Characters/George\|George]] as a step in her plan, but we really don't know enough about her motivations to make this theory work. It's far fetched, but it's another pin on the board of possible hints.

[[Characters/Jessica\|Jessica]] tries to get [[Characters/Shannon\|Shannon]] and [[Characters/George\|George]] together, while [[Characters/Eva\|Eva]] is, uuuh, let's say very skeptical of this relationship.

A short amount of time later, [[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]] gets scolded by [[Characters/Natsuhi\|Natsuhi]] for not being able to properly clean in time the places assigned to her, which is perfectly natural given that she is now doing the job of two people, [[Characters/Shannon\|Shannon]] and [[Characters/Kanon\|Kanon]].

After that, a whole scene where she meets Beato in front of the portrait happens. 
[[Characters/Shannon\|Shannon]] is given the [[Tips/Golden Butterfly Brooch\|Golden Butterfly Brooch]], the ultimate placebo, then [[Characters/Kanon\|Kanon]] and [[Characters/Shannon\|Shannon]] are marked with a burning sign and they are moved around like puppets.

We believe this scene is to be understood as an internal conflict in [[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]]. She's struggling between the cynical and pragmatic [[Characters/Kanon\|Kanon]] and the "longing for something more" [[Characters/Shannon\|Shannon]].
The part about Beato being able to give [[Characters/Shannon\|Shannon]] endless gold is obviously referencing the already established golden witch lore.
Meanwhile, as already mentioned, [[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]] breaking the mirror is an allegory to her starting to push the magic narrative that culminates in the family conference of 1986, where the witch will take the blame for everything at the end.

What we see on screen is an extremely magical retelling of what actually happened. As mentioned in [[Long Form Theories/Theory for Legend of the Golden witch#Part 𝑖 The tea party of those who are not human\|The tea party of those who are not human]], this is how the unreliable narrator (the witch [[Characters/Beatrice\|Beatrice]]) is presenting it to us ([[Characters/Bernkastel\|Bernkastel]]).

![Pasted image 20250622132932.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250622132932.png)
<center>I mean, she's literally quoting Bern from the non human tea party.</center>

This prologue as a whole is, in fact, Beato's first real move in this game. She's on the offensive, creating a reason for her existence that Bern wouldn't be able to attack.

This pattern of magic having double meanings will hold for every scene in Rokkenjima where explicit magic is involved. After all, magic isn't just making stuff up, it's about warping one's perception of the events. 
When people buy into a narrative and become convinced that their interpretation is real, they then act based on it and have an impact in the real world.

The following scenes in Rokkenjima where Beato and [[Characters/Kinzo\|Kinzo]] appear only strengthen this interpretation of magic, which will eventually be spelled out pretty definitively in [[Episodes/Alliance of the Golden witch\|Alliance]].

Yes, we're saying that magic in Umineko is a little bit like pro wrestling
![Pasted image 20250527200628.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250527200628.png)
<center>It's still real to me dammit!</center>

So with that established, going forward only the scenes where someone other than [[Characters/Kanon\|Kanon]], [[Characters/Shannon\|Shannon]] or [[Characters/Beatrice\|Beatrice]] are present are to be trusted without a grain (or a massive bag) of salt.

---
#### 1.4
Jessica's school is having a culture festival! Hurray!
Yes, [[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]] is, in fact, trying to set herself up with [[Characters/Jessica\|Jessica]] by using her two identities. It's actually really funny once you notice it, she's not being remotely subtle, she forces it so hard, it's adorable. 

We think this is her actually listening to her heart for once, as signified by [[Characters/Shannon\|Shannon]] giving the golden brooch to [[Characters/Kanon\|Kanon]]. After all, the brooch works if it involves blind love, and ironically this fits [[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]]-[[Characters/Jessica\|Jessica]] better compared to [[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]]-[[Characters/George\|George]]. 
Maybe it also works as a potential hint for [[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]] being a man and not a woman? Since the brooch strengthens relationships between the sexes.

The conversation between [[Characters/Jessica\|Jessica]] and [[Characters/Kanon\|Kanon]] that evening is very revealing when viewed in the context of our theories so far.
![Pasted image 20250527203233.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250527203233.png)
<center>Wow I wonder what that means.</center>

![Pasted image 20250527203319.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250527203319.png)
<center>Truly, a mistery for the ages</center>

![Pasted image 20250527203851.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250527203851.png)
<center>Look at Sayo being put on the spot so hard! Jessica is truly the drunken master of Detective work!</center>

![Pasted image 20250527203434.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250527203434.png)
<center>He forgot! He forgot!</center>


![Pasted image 20250527204737.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250527204737.png)
So. [[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]] harshly refuses [[Characters/Jessica\|Jessica]] in the end. After all, She must be disillusioned by the failure that trying to love [[Characters/George\|George]] produced.

This is where [[Characters/Beatrice\|Beatrice]] starts to turn into a "[[Speculation/Black Magic\|Black Witch]]", AKA where the magic, the cope, the narrative, stops being a benign-ish fantasy and becomes something more obsessive and self absorbed.

That's reflected in the heel turn we see from [[Characters/Beatrice\|Beatrice]] in here next interaction with [[Characters/Kanon\|Kanon]], in which he steps on the brooch, the benign magical tool that was the catalyst for [[Characters/Beatrice\|Beatrice]].
![Pasted image 20250622141801.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250622141801.png)


Two seeds sown today ([[Characters/Jessica\|Jessica]] and [[Characters/Kanon\|Kanon]]) and one already sown. and then the scene immediately shifts to [[Characters/Kinzo\|Kinzo]]. (We aren't even considering [[Characters/George\|George]]!)
Now granted, there is another working explanation for this one, which is [[Characters/Kinzo\|Kinzo]] already being dead and not counting.
![Pasted image 20250527205249.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250527205249.png)

We should add, It's probably very reasonable that [[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]] wants nothing to do with [[Characters/George\|George]] at this point, given his complete inability to read the room.
![Pasted image 20250527205828.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250527205828.png)
[[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]] is barely an adult, still working for your family in a very subservient position, and they don't even share that much confidence. I'm not sure they even kissed! Did they ever talk about personal stuff?
Of course you've also gotta feel bad for [[Characters/George\|George]]  here. Because, Jesus Christ, it's a miserable level of lack of self awareness, it's so scary to be this clueless and this unaware about how clueless you are.

#### 1.5
We spent a lot of time and words on this prologue because reading it back really made a lot of things click into place. This is the point where we started to to formulate the [[Long Form Theories/Theory for Legend of the Golden witch#Part 2 The Sayo Conjecture\|Sayo conjecture]], and that became the core of our theory once we saw it could hold up to scrutiny.

Let's actually get started setting up the board for the next game now.
We spend some time observing the "chessboard preparations" for the first confrontation between [[Characters/Battler\|Battler]] and Beato. It's technically the second, but keep in mind that during [[Episodes/Legend of the Golden witch\|Legend]] [[Characters/Battler\|Battler]] wasn't yet a willing participant.

Here are some of the scenes worth discussing.

We see [[Characters/Rosa\|Rosa]] severely mistreating [[Characters/Maria\|Maria]] on the train, and when she eventually calms down they land on the narrative that [[Characters/Rosa\|Rosa]] was being possessed by an evil witch. This is clearly far from the first time this has happened.
This ties back to the general idea of the [[Speculation/Black Magic\|Black Witch]], it's a violent form of ideation used to deal with bad circumstances, although here it escalates from idea to action a bit too quickly... 
They buy some halloween candy on their way to the airport.

![Pasted image 20250622143005.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250622143005.png)
We see [[Characters/Krauss\|Krauss]] discussing something with [[Characters/Natsuhi\|Natsuhi]], they talk about needing to keep the others away from [[Characters/Kinzo\|Kinzo]] with the cooperation of [[Characters/Genji\|Genji]] and [[Characters/Nanjo\|Nanjo]]. 
They're clearly talking about hiding Kinzo's death, which of course needs to remain a secret.

Then, we finally see [[Characters/Beatrice\|Beatrice]] and [[Characters/Battler\|Battler]] in the tea party. 
![Pasted image 20250622161513.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250622161513.png)
When Beato announces the start of the game (with a distinct lack of quotation marks, meaning she is narrating this), the background of the tea party turns purple, which to us is a tell that what is happening stopped being a magical parallel of something real. 
This color filter basically marks the magical scenes that happen outside the game and don't constitute hints for solving the game itself.

Whenever a meta scene needs to be overlayed over images from the game they will instead use this transparent flower pattern as framing. This has the same meaning as the purple filter in the tea party.
![Pasted image 20250622162216.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250622162216.png)

This all makes perfect sense, but as you'll surely remember, the tea party of [[Episodes/Legend of the Golden witch\|Legend]] didn't have a purple filter! So we need to ask ourselves, is [[Characters/Battler\|Battler]] and [[Characters/Beatrice\|Beatrice]] arguing about the existence of witches also a parallel to something happening in the real world?

It could go something like "[[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]] and [[Characters/Battler\|Battler]] survived the events of Rokkenjima but [[Characters/Battler\|Battler]] was imprisoned and forced to witness all of this", or maybe, "[[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]] survived the games and is fantasizing about alternative versions of the story, writing them down, and distributing them as *[[Mysteries/Future mysteries/Bottled letters\|bottled letters]]*". 
This question will become relevant once we get to [[Episodes/Alliance of the Golden witch\|Alliance]].

Lastly, when [[Characters/Battler\|Battler]] tells Beato that he'll play with her until she loses patience, Beato asks if a certain witch planted this idea in his mind. She's referring to [[Characters/Bernkastel\|Bernkastel]], given the conversation they had in the first tea party of those who are not human.

---
#### 1.6
The game has officially started and we're about to meet a new friend, but first, a bizarre scene takes place.

In the rose garden, once again [[Characters/Rosa\|Rosa]] lashes out at [[Characters/Maria\|Maria]] for talking about witches, and steps on her candy before leaving [[Characters/Maria\|Maria]] alone. Truly one of the mothers of all time.

[[Characters/Kanon\|Kanon]] approaches [[Characters/Maria\|Maria]] and offers her the other candy he had received from her earlier, which she refuses. Then [[Characters/Kanon\|Kanon]] asks her if she knows [[Characters/Beatrice\|Beatrice]], and [[Characters/Maria\|Maria]] suggests that they invite the witch to play.
![Pasted image 20250528183927.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250528183927.png)
![Pasted image 20250528183939.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250528183939.png)

Our theory so far states that [[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]] is the [[Characters/Beatrice\|Beatrice]] who formed Mariage Sorcière with [[Characters/Maria\|Maria]], so she should know very well who [[Characters/Kanon\|Kanon]] is, and [[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]] shouldn't need to ask this question when it's just the two of them.
 
Of course, it's possible [[Characters/Maria\|Maria]] only knows about the [[Characters/Shannon\|Shannon]] persona and not the [[Characters/Kanon\|Kanon]] one, it could fit the rest of the theory with a couple small adjustments... but there's another explanation that fits even better.

Yes, [[Characters/Maria\|Maria]] knows [[Characters/Kanon\|Kanon]] IS [[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]], but to her he isn't [[Characters/Beatrice\|Beatrice]]. 
As it'll becomes clear in [[Episodes/Alliance of the Golden witch\|Alliance]], [[Characters/Maria\|Maria]] is another character who lives by her magical interpretation of reality, and in the endless witch narrative surrounding [[Characters/Beatrice\|Beatrice]], [[Characters/Kanon\|Kanon]] and [[Characters/Shannon\|Shannon]] are furniture made by [[Characters/Kinzo\|Kinzo]]. 
This is why [[Characters/Maria\|Maria]] won't interact with [[Characters/Kanon\|Kanon]] as [[Characters/Beatrice\|Beatrice]] and vice versa, to them the roleplay is part of the magic, so in this scene she will not accept a replacement candy from [[Characters/Kanon\|Kanon]], but if the witch [[Characters/Beatrice\|Beatrice]] were to show up, then she would close her eyes and accept a simple switcheroo as magic.

And sure enough...
![Pasted image 20250713205857.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250713205857.png)
Soon after this, [[Characters/Rosa\|Rosa]] comes back to check on [[Characters/Maria\|Maria]]... and she's surprised by the appearance of someone who she didn't expect to see ever again. Someone who looks exactly like the person of the portrait. Who could this person be?

If you've picked up on the pattern you might expect us to claim that she too is [[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]], but we'll soon argue that this can't be the case. 
That's right, she's not getting ALL the blame this time.

In order to solve turn we will need someone who exceeds expectations, someone a bit more exotic, definitely exalted, and at the risk of exaggerating, dare I say exceptional.

Are you ready? Excellent.

## Part 2: The X factor
<center><i>Supposing the existence of a mysterious "person X"... </i></center>

#### 2.1

![not like the others.png](/img/user/Attachments/not%20like%20the%20others.png)
<center><i>One of these things is not like the others... one of these things... doesn't belong.</i></center>

<font color="#00b0f0">Let's state this; In the context of Turn of the Golden witch, there are 17 people in Rokkenjima.</font>

<center><font color="#00b0f0" size="5">Battler</font></center>
<center><font color="#00b0f0" size="5">Eva</font></center>
<center><font color="#00b0f0" size="5">Genji</font></center>
<center><font color="#00b0f0" size="5">George</font></center>
<center><font color="#00b0f0" size="5">Godha</font></center>
<center><font color="#00b0f0" size="5">Hideyoshi</font></center>
<center><font color="#00b0f0" size="5">Jessica</font></center>
<center><font color="#00b0f0" size="5">Krauss</font></center>
<center><font color="#00b0f0" size="5">Kumasawa</font></center>
<center><font color="#00b0f0" size="5">Kyrie</font></center>
<center><font color="#00b0f0" size="5">Maria</font></center>

<center><font color="#00b0f0" size="5">Rudolf</font></center>
<center><font color="#00b0f0" size="5">Sayo</font></center>

<center>And finally...</center>

<center><font color="#00b0f0" size="5">A mysterious person X who looks like Beatrice, shortened to X Beatrice</font></center>


[[Characters/X Beatrice\|X Beatrice]] is the special guest that appears in Turn and [[Episodes/Alliance of the Golden witch\|Alliance]], who several people remark to be the spitting image of the witch's portrait.
She can be distinguished from [[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]] by her clothes, possibly her face, and because of the *[[Speculation/Leg Tattoos\|tattoos or marks]]* we see on their legs in the character profiles.

| ![Pasted image 20250528190002.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250528190002.png) | ![Pasted image 20250528190017.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250528190017.png) |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
<center>Sayo's right leg is hidden but X beatrice's left leg is clearly missing the shape present on Sayo's.</center>


This is a small detail, but one that the author had to put there on purpose, and he did it in such a way that we can see they don't match.

In case this wasn't enough evidence, another strong hint that they must be separate people will come near the end of [[Episodes/Alliance of the Golden witch\|Alliance]], when we will see the two of them interact inside the game world as two versions of [[Characters/Beatrice\|Beatrice]] and get to see a glimpse of what X's motivations might be.

She will also be helpful whenever two corpses are needed for the price of one, or she can still be around even when [[Characters/Kanon\|Kanon]], [[Characters/Shannon\|Shannon]], or both are confirmed to be dead by the Red truth.

---
#### 2.2

So, what do we know about this person? 

Well, to start, she looks exactly like the girl in the portrait, so it's possible she was the model used when [[Characters/Kinzo\|Kinzo]] commissioned it. 
There will be another candidate for that role later on, but that person died long before the portrait was hung in the hall (six years ago at most, since [[Characters/Battler\|Battler]] has never seen it), so it would have been based on old photos.
There's also another version of the same painting in Kinzo's study and we have no idea when that one was painted. It's better not to focus on this too much.

It's possible that she is a servant, this would make her able to own a master key without going against any red truth. Maybe she is one of the other orphans with the On kanji in their name, the ones mentioned in [[Episodes/Legend of the Golden witch\|Legend]].

[[Characters/Genji\|Genji]] talks about her multiple times, even if it's largely in scenes that we can't trust I think it's enough to suggest that they know each other to some degree. 

She talks casually about [[Characters/Kinzo\|Kinzo]], so it's fair to say that she knew him as well.
She refers to herself as a bird in a cage for [[Characters/Kinzo\|Kinzo]], which could mean a number of things, it's not clear if it refers to the general concept of [[Characters/Beatrice\|Beatrice]] or to herself.

And what about her motive? We don't really know. We can at least say that she is an accomplice of [[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]] with goals that align to hers, and her presence serves in part the purpose of validating the existence of a witch.
She will be around and play a role in [[Episodes/Alliance of the Golden witch\|Alliance]] as well, and we think she was the recipient of [[Characters/Battler\|Battler]]'s promise because of what she says there and her reaction to him failing to remember it. 
That is probably a big part of her motive, and the only one we can point out with some confidence.

![Pasted image 20250701192950.png|500](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250701192950.png)

That's as far as our evidence goes, but while we can't 100% say who she is, here's an interesting guess.

We'll soon argue that she disguises herself as [[Characters/Shannon\|Shannon]] at various points in the game, which suggests that she would have some experience in doing so, as well as a physical predisposition.

<font color="#00b050">Hound will quickly point out the amount of assumptions that go into this conjecture, but I believe that she's the twin sister of Sayo, both daughters of the Beatrice who died 19 years prior near Kuwadorian.</font>

They were both raised at the Fukuin house, and learned how to swap between each others. The details of their upbringing are unknown, but the general idea is that they were often in contact with [[Characters/Kinzo\|Kinzo]] and the older servants.  Maybe while [[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]] was getting used to impersonating two servants she would have needed someone else from the orphanage to fill the shoes of [[Characters/Shannon\|Shannon]] from time to time?

<font color="#ffdd33">Ok but. Why does she need to be a twin sister when Shannon doesn't even look like Beatrice? Why does she need to be a sister at all? Can't she just be someone else with a similar body type and some make up?</font>

<font color="#00b050">Well yes, it wouldn't change any of the solution but... How can I put it without going out of topic..... <font color="#e36c09"></font></font>

<font color="#00b050">I'll just say this, I believe that Ryukishi 07 is exactly the kind of author who, in the second chapter of a mystery story, would add a twin sister with basically no involvement in the first chapter for the sake of having them act as each other.</font>

<font color="#00b050">That, combined with the fact that she knows some servants, she's able to act as Shannon, and she wears her clothes well, is enough of a proof to me.</font>

#### 2.3

Now, the existence of [[Characters/X Beatrice\|X Beatrice]] by itself puts something on the table in [[Episodes/Legend of the Golden witch\|Legend]] of the golden witch. Is it possible that [[Characters/Shannon\|Shannon]]'s corpse was none other that the corpse of X dressed as [[Characters/Shannon\|Shannon]]? 
We would need to somehow make the case for her counting as [[Characters/Shannon\|Shannon]] in the red, but if they really did share this identity, it wouldn't be impossible.

Alternatively she was alive in the shed and just playing dead... but that scene really goes out of its way to not show that body to anyone reliable, so ironically it's harder to suspect someone who can convincingly pass for [[Characters/Shannon\|Shannon]].
In the end we figured the explanation was just as effective without her, so she didn't make it into that solution.

We also played around with the idea of [[Characters/X Beatrice\|X Beatrice]] being [[Characters/Kanon\|Kanon]] in the previous scene with [[Characters/Maria\|Maria]], but we always come back to that annoying red truth.

> __No one else can go by [[Characters/Kanon\|Kanon]]'s name! A different person can't claim that as their name!__

If only one person can be [[Characters/Kanon\|Kanon]] then [[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]] takes precedence. We'll just have to assume [[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]] goes away and X shows up instead after [[Characters/Rosa\|Rosa]] comes back.
As for why [[Characters/Maria\|Maria]] doesn't call her out, keep in mind that magic to her is more about form than substance, so even if [[Characters/Beatrice\|Beatrice]] manifests as multiple people she is able to rationalize it.

When [[Characters/Rosa\|Rosa]] sees [[Characters/X Beatrice\|X Beatrice]], she is instead quite shaken.
![Pasted image 20250622183255.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250622183255.png)
Contrary to what the narration says, she is not shocked because [[Characters/Beatrice\|Beatrice]] appeared out of thin air, nor because she repaired Maria's candy with magic, but it's because she is facing the girl in the portrait, the same person who died in front of her 19 years ago.

Or at least, that's what it looks like to her, Rosa's memories of that event aren't perfect, and if they are indeed related a mother would look similar to her child. It's not a far reach to say she saw the portrait that many years later and assumed that must have been exactly what the girl in Kuwadorian looked like. After all, the portrait wears the same dress as the [[Characters/Beatrice\|Beatrice]] of 19 years ago did.

X delivers two envelopes to [[Characters/Maria\|Maria]] and [[Characters/Rosa\|Rosa]]. 
Maria's envelope contains the key to the chapel, making it clear that X will be involved in creating the illusion of the closed rooms. [[Characters/Rosa\|Rosa]] instead receives a different envelope which contains the usual letter to read at the family conference, but also possibly something else.

![Pasted image 20250622184920.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250622184920.png)

In a similar way to [[Characters/Eva\|Eva]] in [[Episodes/Legend of the Golden witch\|Legend]], we believe [[Characters/Rosa\|Rosa]] might have received a warning about the murders and a proposal to side with [[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]]'s group. The reward would be the same as last time: safety and a large sum of money in the form of the same bank card and PIN that the families of the victims received in [[Episodes/Alliance of the Golden witch\|Alliance]].

It's unclear if they all get this proposal individually, or if who gets it is part of the variable starting conditions of each episode, after all X says it could have been any of the siblings. 
Sure, she was told not to open it in advance, but would anyone really trust [[Characters/Rosa\|Rosa]] not to read it the moment she isn't under Maria's sight?

![Pasted image 20250706184259.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250706184259.png)
<center>She foreshadows her appearing to the siblings later that night, or perhaps a secret meeting that Rosa would know about after opening the envelope?</center>

#### 2.4

While the guest of honor is being accompanied to the VIP room by [[Characters/Genji\|Genji]] she is spotted by [[Characters/Kyrie\|Kyrie]] in front of the portrait. She is obviously ok with making her presence known given the nature of the plan she's a part of.

This is where we first see the portrait change to [[Characters/X Beatrice\|X Beatrice]]. Let's come back to this during [[Episodes/Banquet of the Golden witch\|Banquet]], for now we'll just say this change is symbolical and doesn't physically happen.
![Pasted image 20250714211201.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250714211201.png)

She burns her hand trying to open the door to Kinzo's study, what does this mean? Of course this didn't happen, but it might be hinting at her not knowing that [[Characters/Kinzo\|Kinzo]] is dead, although we don't ever need this to be true.


![Pasted image 20250722120907.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250722120907.png)

[[Characters/Rosa\|Rosa]] insists that Godha shouldn't carry her bag to her room, which is relevant because Godha not feeling the weight of any gold ingots in the luggage is brought up later on as evidence that no one smuggled in the gold. 
I say that, but I have no idea how to make this whole "[[Characters/Rosa\|Rosa]] brought in the gold" hunch fit in with anything else. I'll still mention it here because it looks important.
Meanwhile, we know Godha isn't allowed to interact with [[Characters/X Beatrice\|X Beatrice]], since he complains about not being able to carry the food to her room.

Later in the day, both [[Characters/Kanon\|Kanon]] and [[Characters/Shannon\|Shannon]] meet [[Characters/X Beatrice\|X Beatrice]] in the VIP room, and this time they are both hostile towards her.
Now, it's very possible this is just a continuation of the magic narrative from the prologue, but it could also hint at a conflict between [[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]] and X's goals. For instance, they could be having disagreement about who should be the sacrifices, or elements of their plan.


![Pasted image 20250623185730.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250623185730.png)

[[Characters/Kanon\|Kanon]] and [[Characters/Shannon\|Shannon]] take for granted that they will be put to rest and likely die once the Golden Land is opened, which might mean that if they go forward with the plan, [[Characters/Shannon\|Shannon]] and [[Characters/Kanon\|Kanon]] as identities, will become redundant and be discarded along with their respective love interests.

#### 2.5

During the family dinner, the existence of [[Characters/Beatrice\|Beatrice]] is revealed to everyone. 

[[Characters/Kyrie\|Kyrie]] and [[Characters/Rosa\|Rosa]] corroborate by offering their testimony, however [[Characters/Rosa\|Rosa]] doesn't read out loud the letter given to her, so we can't say for certain that it was the same as the one [[Characters/Maria\|Maria]] received last round. In [[Episodes/Legend of the Golden witch\|Legend]], the first letter was meant to set up the presence of [[Characters/Beatrice\|Beatrice]], but this time the supposed witch is a person they can physically meet, with far more evidence than "Somebody handed [[Characters/Maria\|Maria]] an umbrella".

But here comes the counterpoint. If this envelope really did contain a message directed at [[Characters/Rosa\|Rosa]] in particular, (either the plans for the upcoming murders or details on how to contact [[Characters/Beatrice\|Beatrice]] in secret), they would have to account for the risk of [[Characters/Rosa\|Rosa]] blindly bringing it up without reading it first.
Any way you slice it this isn't a very strategic choice, but hey, this is the episode where we're told that sometimes [[Characters/Beatrice\|Beatrice]] likes to play suboptimal moves on purpose. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

The fact [[Characters/Rosa\|Rosa]] claims to have seen a witch makes us think she's already playing into it to some extent, and soon her cooperation will be a crucial piece of the puzzle, so we'll say [[Characters/Rosa\|Rosa]] probably knew the content of the letter and didn't think sharing that fact with her siblings would benefit her.

Soon after the topic comes up, [[Characters/Gohda\|Gohda]] and the kids are kicked out to the guesthouse, and once again, [[Characters/Maria\|Maria]] shows that she's totally on board with the witch narrative.

All the Ushiromiya adults are left alone with [[Characters/Genji\|Genji]] as they interrogate him on the identity of the guest.

#### 2.6

The next scene is bizzarre.

[[Characters/George\|George]], proposes to [[Characters/Shannon\|Shannon]] just like in [[Episodes/Legend of the Golden witch\|Legend]]. That time she seemed very unsure after receiving the ring, which lines up with what we derived from the part 1 flashbacks, but this time she strangely accepts immediately and with enthusiasm. 
![Pasted image 20250715003234.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250715003234.png)

We have fairly contrasting interpretations of this scene so we figured it would be better to just present both.

<font color="#00b050">On one hand, I think that at this point X Beatrice is already dressed as Shannon and is the one accepting George's proposal. This would imply she either likes George or is out to deceive him for some reason.</font>
<font color="#00b050">I'm just not buying that it's Sayo because I can't see what the manipulation is for, so I'll say that here Shannon is X.</font>

<font color="#00b050">That being said... It's really weird that she'd be this much into marriage, specifically, and there's definitely something I'm missing. But what I'm not missing is that Sayo would NEVER act this way. She didn't shy away from being uncommitted towards George, not only earlier in this game, but in Legend too.</font>

<font color="#ffdd33">On the other hand, I don't see enough signs of a switch up, instead this change in attitude could be explained as:</font>
- <font color="#ffdd33">A narration trick to make Shannon the character seem far more proactive.</font>
- <font color="#ffdd33">Sayo making peace with the fact that she likes both him an Jessica despite his creepy behavior, fueled by the whole "we're all going to die shortly" mindset.</font>
- <font color="#ffdd33">She actually really enjoys making George suffer.</font>
- <font color="#ffdd33">A combination thereof.</font>

<font color="#ffdd33">Maybe in her mind, at the end of this big group suicide they really will get to live happily ever after in the golden land.</font>

#### 2.7

Right after the marriage proposal, [[Characters/Shannon\|Shannon]] and [[Characters/Kanon\|Kanon]] have another conversation in which [[Characters/Kanon\|Kanon]] admits he wants to be a human and be with [[Characters/Jessica\|Jessica]].
The regular dress [[Characters/Beatrice\|Beatrice]] shows up under the rain to comment on it, notably without any quotation marks. 
![Pasted image 20250627154350.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250627154350.png)

To reiterate, this is the [[Characters/Beatrice\|Beatrice]] from the tea party speaking as the narrator, she embodies [[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]]'s endless witch narrative and she interfaces with [[Characters/Bernkastel\|Bernkastel]] and the version of [[Characters/Battler\|Battler]] at the highest level of abstraction, both stand ins for the reader.

Midway through the monologue she transitions to [[Characters/X Beatrice\|X Beatrice]]. 
From a meta point of view this marks her adding one of her pieces to the chessboard, and it's only natural that the Platonic idea of [[Characters/Beatrice\|Beatrice]] can take both forms at will.

On a lower level of abstraction, it could mean both [[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]] and X at this point are working towards building the same narrative.
![Pasted image 20250531163717.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250531163717.png)

Cut to the siblings talking to [[Characters/X Beatrice\|X Beatrice]] in the chapel, we don't see what led up to it but now suddenly everyone is acknowledging her as a witch, or at least the narrator says so.
## Part 3: The first twilight
<center><i>Happy halloween MARIA</i></center>

#### 3.1

Let's rewind to a little before midnight: what actually happened to the adults?

For starters, we know for a fact they were murdered right there in the *[[Mysteries/Episode 2 mysteries/Crime scene in the chapel\|Chapel]]* by somebody in the same location.

>__When the six were murdered in the chapel, the culprit was inside the chapel.__

[[Characters/Genji\|Genji]] probably told the group that the guest was waiting for them in the Chapel, so they all followed him there. Only [[Characters/Rosa\|Rosa]] possibly had an idea of what was really going to happen.

When they arrived the door was unlocked, and [[Characters/Beatrice\|Beatrice]] was indeed inside.
From there, the simplest reconstruction is to say that, just like in [[Episodes/Legend of the Golden witch\|Legend]], they were ambushed and murdered in cold blood by [[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]] armed with Kinzo's shotgun, which she was hiding under her clothes. 

In this case, the witch pandering was all fake, and the reason why we can have a fake scene involving people not sold on the magic narrative is that those people died there, this will come up again with [[Characters/Jessica\|Jessica]] and [[Characters/George\|George]].
And yes, the [[Tips/Winchester M1984 Sawed off\|shotgun]] only has 4+1 bullets, so that means at least two guns (and probably two gunmen) were involved, luckily there are a few candidates.

The accomplices from [[Episodes/Legend of the Golden witch\|Legend]] excluding [[Characters/Eva\|Eva]] would of course also be complicit this time around for the same reasons, although if "__[[Characters/Genji\|Genji]], [[Characters/Kumasawa\|Kumasawa]], and [[Characters/Nanjo\|Nanjo]] are not killers__" applies to all episodes this disqualifies [[Characters/Genji\|Genji]] from pulling the trigger.
[[Characters/Rosa\|Rosa]] was present and yet she survived the ordeal, so we think she ended up going along with the plan, and for what it's worth she wears the rifle pretty well.
That said, [[Characters/X Beatrice\|X Beatrice]] is the most obvious candidate for a second killer, let's say she was having a conversation with the group, then at some point [[Characters/Shannon\|Shannon]] showed up, she was allowed inside, and then they opened fire at the same time.

After the ordeal they carefully prepared the scene with the help of [[Characters/Genji\|Genji]], and of course, they didn't forget to sabotage the phone and radio lines just like in [[Episodes/Legend of the Golden witch\|Legend]].

(Note that this solution applies regardless of who was wearing [[Characters/Shannon\|Shannon]] and Beatrice's clothes in that exact moment, they were both there, they are both guilty.)


---
#### 3.2

But what if instead of ignoring the short exchange we saw, we instead assume it actually took place word for word?

> ~[[Speculation/Transcript of the conversation in the Chapel\|Transcript of the conversation in the Chapel]]

Abstracting the sentences from the context of the narration, we see [[Characters/X Beatrice\|X Beatrice]] has presented irrefutable proof of some unthinkable fact, such as for instance a birth certificate, a DNA test, and/or a will signed by [[Characters/Kinzo\|Kinzo]] that proves she has a right to the inheritance.

It seems that whatever this revelation is, it caused caused the siblings to all agree to some kind of contract or proposition that hinges on them formally acknowledging her. The wording and attitude shown isn't so different from when they were acting like [[Characters/Krauss\|Krauss]] had 10 tons of gold in order to put pressure on him.

If this is them being indirect, then perhaps they settle for calling her a witch because not doing so would put them in a bad spot, like having to legally give her one part or all of the inheritance.

![Pasted image 20250715011041.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250715011041.png)

Of course, this alone doesn't explain why they all end up dead. Maybe from X's point of view they stopped being useful once they signed whatever they needed to sign, and that's when [[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]] showed up, or maybe their goals weren't really aligned after all.




---
#### 3.3


We've handled the whodunnit, now how do we solve the glaring closed room case? After all... 

> __From the time [[Characters/Maria\|Maria]] received her key to the instant [[Characters/Rosa\|Rosa]] unsealed the envelope the next day, the key passed through no one's hands!!__

There's a very simple way out of the apparent contradiction. The door was never closed to begin with, and putting the real chapel key in the envelope was only meant to create the illusion of a closed room.

And yes, [[Characters/Beatrice\|Beatrice]] did give a [[Speculation/Beatrice's Definitions\|definition]] of what she means by closed room that excludes unlocked doors, but none of the red truths relating to the chapel explicitly describe it as a closed room.

With this new insight, let's examine the dynamics of how they discover the crime scene.
When the morning comes, [[Characters/Genji\|Genji]] wakes up [[Characters/Rosa\|Rosa]] and they go back to the Chapel to meet [[Characters/Gohda\|Gohda]], [[Characters/Shannon\|Shannon]] and [[Characters/Kanon\|Kanon]].
![Pasted image 20250718125524.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250718125524.png)

Let's address the furniture in the room first, why are [[Characters/Kanon\|Kanon]] and [[Characters/Shannon\|Shannon]] here while it's not a magical scene? Isn't [[Characters/Gohda\|Gohda]] supposed to be a reliable witness not involved in the murders or the magical narrative? 

The explanation hinges on whether [[Characters/Gohda\|Gohda]] is aware of [[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]]'s double identity or not.
Let's say he doesn't know, then we would need to claim that [[Characters/Shannon\|Shannon]] is currently [[Characters/X Beatrice\|X Beatrice]] (and Hound would have to drop his skepticism), but there's another explanation.

We think it's more likely that he knows and begrudgingly accepts it because it's something [[Characters/Kinzo\|Kinzo]] imposed on all servants, and from what we know of [[Characters/Gohda\|Gohda]], he would go along with whatever his employer wants. (This doesn't stop him from disliking [[Characters/Kanon\|Kanon]] though, after all he's getting outranked twice by the same kid.)

But in this case, we have a scene where everyone present knows about [[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]] and is keeping the secret, so we haven't broken our own rules. Furthermore, like every scene they shared so far, there's a deceptive reason why the author is showing it to us.

[[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]] aside, we don't think [[Characters/Gohda\|Gohda]] is in on the crimes, it doesn't jive with our impression of his character, and especially with the [[Tips/Notes from a Certain Chef\|Notes from a Certain Chef]]. So when [[Characters/Rosa\|Rosa]] plays her part and goes to get the key from Maria's envelope he becomes a witness to this supposed closed room.

![Pasted image 20250718133131.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250718133131.png)
<center>We were initially trying to contextualize this scene as a way to deceive an innocent Rosa, but if she personally twists the key, that becomes a lot less likely.</center>

This interpretation assumes [[Characters/Gohda\|Gohda]] believed the others and didn't try to open the door himself, which isn't the most reliable plan ever, but it's important to reiterate: reliability isn't [[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]]/[[Characters/Beatrice\|Beatrice]]'s top priority, making risky moves is a known habit of hers.
Alternatively one could always say this scene didn't go exactly as shown. Maybe [[Characters/Rosa\|Rosa]] didn't twist the key, or maybe [[Characters/Gohda\|Gohda]] was ordered or convinced to lie about it. It's much weaker but it's an option.


Moving on, the cousins wake up to [[Characters/Maria\|Maria]] throwing a tantrum about [[Characters/Rosa\|Rosa]] opening the envelope, so they immediately know something is going on regarding a locked door, then they see [[Characters/Kanon\|Kanon]] and [[Characters/Gohda\|Gohda]] asking [[Characters/Nanjo\|Nanjo]] to follow them.

![Pasted image 20250601211636.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250601211636.png)
This exchange could also be read as them discussing something [[Characters/Rosa\|Rosa]] did to mess up their plans, but the fact it happened in public makes it far more likely that it's just them acting surprised.

[[Characters/Shannon\|Shannon]] is sent away to have a scene with [[Characters/Kinzo\|Kinzo]], just in time for [[Characters/Battler\|Battler]] to miss seeing her and [[Characters/Kanon\|Kanon]] together, how strange....

Here's a recap of what they find at the crime scene.
- Beatrice's introduction letter that may or may not have been in Rosa's envelope, the same one [[Characters/Maria\|Maria]] had in [[Episodes/Legend of the Golden witch\|Legend]]. It definitely has the intended effect on the survivors.
- 3 bars of Gold, it's probably Krauss's gold that we saw in [[Episodes/Legend of the Golden witch\|Legend]], although it's not clear how [[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]] gained access to them, maybe [[Characters/Krauss\|Krauss]] showed them to everyone as part of the negotiations.
- [[Characters/Battler\|Battler]] examined the corpses personally and he didn't find any bullet holes, but we could easily argue that during the "post processing" of the bodies they were cut over the gun wounds.
- Alongside the magic circle outside the door there's some english text reading "HAPPY HALLOWEEN FOR... [[Characters/Maria\|Maria]]".

[[Characters/Nanjo\|Nanjo]] proposes locking the door of the chapel, but later it will be implied to be unlocked during the murder in Natsuhi's room. We must assume they faked locking it for whatever reason, maybe as a possible setup, although it will end up backfiring and letting the last group of victims escape.

[[Characters/Rosa\|Rosa]] strongly claims that the chapel was a closed room, which is really easy to doubt as from the point of view of a character in the story without access to the red truth.
This could suggest that the original plan failed in some way, and what they're going with right now is some kind of contingency.


---
#### 3.4

Up in the tea party layer we have the first introduction of the [[Red Truth\|red truth]] as a mechanic, and it reads more as a tutorial round for [[Characters/Battler\|Battler]].

![Pasted image 20250718141559.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250718141559.png)

We were able to narrow down our solution thanks to the red truths revealed at the end of [[Episodes/Alliance of the Golden witch\|Alliance]], but [[Characters/Battler\|Battler]] doesn't have the same luxury, so he "solves" the closed room by claiming that someone took the key, locked the door, and then resealed Maria's envelope. 

But why did Beato wait two games before countering this wrong theory? She could have easily removed his check at any time, right? Especially since it didn't come up as a way to lay another trap later on.

As hinted at by [[Characters/Bernkastel\|Bernkastel]] and [[Characters/Lambdadelta\|Lambdadelta]], this is one of many examples of Beato not playing to the best of her abilities, she isn't trying use her full potential to crush [[Characters/Battler\|Battler]], instead using this opportunity to teach him how the red truth works. 
He needs to learn the rules before they can play, and the fact that [[Characters/Beatrice\|Beatrice]] wants him to improve is a first hint towards her true motives.

## Part 4: The second twilight
<center>(Teleports behind you) "Nothin personnel kid"</center>

#### 4.1
[[Characters/Jessica\|Jessica]], [[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]] ([[Characters/Kanon\|Kanon]]) and [[Characters/Gohda\|Gohda]] rush to the VIP room and find a bed that has been slept on. Either [[Characters/X Beatrice\|X Beatrice]] actually slept there, or she was busy helping with the corpses that night, so they made it look like she did, it hardly changes anything. 

![Pasted image 20250726110352.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250726110352.png)
<center><i>Maybe</i> this door was actually locked.</center>

[[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]] pretends to find a letter, which she actually secretly had on her person. 
The contents are mocking Jessica's parents, but the language is vague enough that it would have worked no matter which of the cousins read it first, she just happened to get there before anyone else.

The letter triggers Jessica's asthma and she heads stumbling to her room. [[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]] sends Godha away before helping her reach the destination, and then...

![Pasted image 20250803194953.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250803194953.png)

Look! There are [[Characters/Goats\|goats]], demons and magic, and [[Characters/Kanon\|Kanon]]'s hand became a sword! I guess that settles it then, witches exist.......

![b2d0e0b218f71d0f273ff2cfea28ed38.gif](/img/user/Attachments/b2d0e0b218f71d0f273ff2cfea28ed38.gif)
<center>OF COURSE NOT!!!</center>

This just the most blatant example yet of narrator [[Characters/Beatrice\|Beatrice]] twisting the story to fit the narrative, and she can do that because, yet again, there are no reliable witnesses to contradict her!
[[Characters/Jessica\|Jessica]] is innocent according to our interpretation, sure, but she is dead and dead people can't testify.
You can probably see the irony in [[Characters/Beatrice\|Beatrice]] summoning her and [[Characters/Kanon\|Kanon]] as ghosts later on and having them testify as a way to lean into tea party [[Characters/Battler\|Battler]]'s moral dilemma.  Since they exited the scene the narrator can do whatever she wants with their characters as long as it doesn't have any repercussions on reality.

But while it would be tempting to ignore the magic battle entirely, its interpretation actually has a very large impact on the rest of the episode.

If we were to take all the magic literally, the plot of this episode would be about [[Characters/Kanon\|Kanon]] and [[Characters/Shannon\|Shannon]] defying [[Characters/Beatrice\|Beatrice]], getting relentlessly toyed with, and eventually being tragically killed alongside their crushes. It makes for a nice compelling story, but if we work under the assumption that the witch and human sides rhyme with each other, then this narrative has to function as an allegory of some sort for the real course of events.

Furthermore, each interpretations has to fulfill a few conditions to be satisfactory.
- A reading has to accomodate all events shown one way or another, we don't want to mix them up.
- It can't contradict any red truth without at least giving a reasonable alternative interpretation. In particular, [[Characters/Kanon\|Kanon]] is not and has never been impersonated by anyone other than [[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]], that red is too hard to circumvent with a loophole.
-  It has to be a direction that makes the story have thematic sense.

As of now we have two working readings, both with pros and cons.

| The death of the original leader could explain some discrepancies in the plan from Legend.                            | It doesn't look like the sacrifices were predetermined anyway.                                                                                           |


Now... Why would we split our theories? More importantly, why would we choose to consider one for which the red truth "**Kanon was killed in this room**" *clearly just doesn't work*?
Chekhov's gun.
The rest of the theory just works really really well if we make that simple assumption that we're missing something about that red. This isn't even going into how much we'd like that to be true for *Banquet of the golden witch*.

TLDR; We have some amazing interpretations that rely on [[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]] being alive. But we'll keep, as a contingency plan, another functioning interpretation.
From now on both scenarios will be taken into consideration when coming up with solutions, but for obvious reasons, they cannot both be true. 
This is ok, and it's to be expected, the very concept of [[Characters/Battler\|Battler]]'s blue truth suggests that the goal of the reader shouldn't be to narrow everything down to a single killer solution, but to cast a broader net. That is what we're doing here, and at the end we will pass the burden of denying each theory over to the witch side in the answer arcs.

<center style="max-width: 400px; margin: 0 auto;">One has to wonder how a witch could possibly win this game.... Surely that won't become a major theme.</center>


Lastly, before moving on, we almost forgot to mention them because of how secondary they are to everything, but [[Characters/The Seven Stakes of Purgatory\|The Seven Stakes of Purgatory]] make an appearance here for the first time. They are furniture, so like the [[Characters/Goats\|goats]] they don't correspond to real people, instead they're the magic side personification of the piercing weapons found stuck in most of the corpses.
No, they can't actually fly at high speeds on their own and bounce on walls.

#### 4.2

[[Characters/Rosa\|Rosa]] leaves [[Characters/Battler\|Battler]] and the rest in the guest room, heading to Kinzo's study, where she meets [[Characters/Genji\|Genji]] and [[Characters/Shannon\|Shannon]], who supposedly stayed there during both the chapel debate and Jessica's murder, but only [[Characters/Rosa\|Rosa]] backs up that claim.

According to reading A, the [[Characters/Shannon\|Shannon]] here is of course [[Characters/X Beatrice\|X Beatrice]], however in the case of Reading B this isn't 100% necessary, as long as [[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]] had the time to change identity after killing [[Characters/Jessica\|Jessica]] and before meeting up with [[Characters/Rosa\|Rosa]].

[[Characters/Kinzo\|Kinzo]] asks [[Characters/Shannon\|Shannon]] to write down his will and autobiography, or in his words, a records of his past games.
![Pasted image 20250726112538.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250726112538.png)


If this scene has some foundation in reality, it could imply X was busy writing down the *[[Mysteries/Future mysteries/Bottled letters\|Bottled letters]]*, which are records of the games. At the very least though, it's an alibi they agreed on, since [[Characters/Shannon\|Shannon]] references it later ("the master ordered me to copy down something").

It's worth mentioning that this is the only episode where the smell of Kinzo's body being burned doesn't fill the mansion. We think the body was in the incinerator as usual, but they never turned it on for some reason, which leads to the body not being found and [[Characters/Kinzo\|Kinzo]] not being counted among the sacrifices. 
This potentially supports reading A, where [[Characters/X Beatrice\|X Beatrice]] has decided to override the sacrifice list in [[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]]'s original plan, if such a predetermined list even exists.

As for what happened after [[Characters/Rosa\|Rosa]] arrived, we can't know what they talked about exactly, but it's probably important because from here on [[Characters/Rosa\|Rosa]] has a pretty big change in attitude. This is signified by a butterfly stopping on Rosa's shoulder. 
Maybe they told her about how they just killed [[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]], or maybe she still didn't know that [[Characters/Kinzo\|Kinzo]] was dead and she's finding it out like this.

Regardless of the reason, she's a lot more resolute now, and she's convinced that working with the culprits is in her and Maria's best interest now. They must have made a very solid deal, especially considering the fact that she's being trusted with a rifle. 

![Pasted image 20250726114234.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250726114234.png)

#### 4.3

Onward to the investigation of *[[Mysteries/Episode 2 mysteries/Crime scene in Jessica's room\|Jessica's Room]]*.
[[Characters/Rosa\|Rosa]] is once again the first person to interact with the door of a closed room, except now we have reliable witnesses. Of course, this is easily explained by claiming that they took a detour and closed it on their way back from the study.
That being said, [[Characters/Rosa\|Rosa]] arrives there before anyone else, which gives her a chance to close the room herself. Maybe she was on a time crunch and she only now got the opportunity to create the closed room, or maybe it means nothing and the door was already closed.

Because Jessica's own key was inside the room, the suspicion quickly turns to the people who had master keys with them. 
[[Characters/Rosa\|Rosa]] fabricates an alibi for [[Characters/Genji\|Genji]] and [[Characters/Shannon\|Shannon]], and she lets [[Characters/Gohda\|Gohda]] and [[Characters/Kumasawa\|Kumasawa]] off the hook with some fairly weak logic. Their goal is of course to blame [[Characters/Kanon\|Kanon]], who very conveniently went missing.

![Pasted image 20250726121356.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250726121356.png)
<center>By acting as each other's alibi, Rosa Genji and X can claim that only Kanon would have been able to close the door using a master key.</center>

In the tea party layer we see Beato with the ghosts of [[Characters/Kanon\|Kanon]] and [[Characters/Jessica\|Jessica]]. As already mentioned it's a plot device to sell the whole "everyone is innocent" story to Bernkastel, who is the only person on the human side that sees it. 
In general, Beato's narrative seems very invested in removing culpability from everyone except the general concept of "[[Characters/Beatrice\|Beatrice]]". This is very reminiscent of the passage in Maria's diary in [[Episodes/Alliance of the Golden witch\|Alliance]], when she talks about the 20th kid in the classroom taking the blame to keep the other 19 kids safe.

If we want to keep claiming that Beatrice's goals and ideals reflect [[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]]'s goals and ideas, this implies that framing [[Characters/Kanon\|Kanon]] and the other servants is either a set up for a magical explanation later, when it turns out no human could have done it after all, or it's something [[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]] wouldn't approve of, adding credibility to the theory that she is dead. Or maybe it's a clever setup, and [[Characters/Rosa\|Rosa]] is told to aggressively frame everyone else as guilty to trigger a reaction from [[Characters/Battler\|Battler]] when he sees them being treated so unjustly.
We're not really sure which one of these works best, or if we missed a better reading.

Be as it may, [[Characters/Rosa\|Rosa]] has taken on the role of casting suspicion on everybody, including her accomplices as soon as they leave. Regardless of the reason, [[Characters/Rosa\|Rosa]], who is in a position of power, is doubting everybody.

![Pasted image 20250810152638.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250810152638.png)
<center>She is disregarding the existence of Kinzo in this argument after she lied about seeing him alive. She's just throwing out accusations for the sake of it.</center>


Then, when anyone tries to doubt [[Characters/Rosa\|Rosa]] herself, her defense is "I can't be the bad guy cause I haven't shot you yet". What a queen.
To be fair it's possible she isn't a murderer and probably has no intention to use the rifle unless absolutely forced to, but she needs to act tough and play along because it's her best shot (no pun intended) at keeping herself and [[Characters/Maria\|Maria]] safe.

![Pasted image 20250810154821.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250810154821.png)

Worth noting, in Jessica's room [[Characters/Rosa\|Rosa]] whispers something to [[Characters/Nanjo\|Nanjo]]. It's possible that in that instance she received from him the master key he found on Jessica's body.

---
#### 4.4

Lastly, observe how tea party [[Characters/Beatrice\|Beatrice]] kindly restricts the space of possibilities for us by confirming the number of keys so we can narrow down our solutions more effectively. 
![Pasted image 20250726120252.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250726120252.png)
<center>Seriously, how is a witch supposed to win?</center>

This red is worth dissecting, considering that for close to two episodes now we've been preaching that two of the servants are the same person and we're going forward with that as one of our axioms.
Because there are technically only 4 servants on the island, if we want to read this statement as strictly as possible it's implying that [[Characters/X Beatrice\|X Beatrice]] is a servant, be it Lanon, Manon or maybe even Anon!
Of course, two of the keys could also simply belong to [[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]], it's not worded so strictly that it doesn't allow that interpretation.


---
## Part 5: An incredibly complex sequence of events that somehow makes sense
<center>At this point it's not even deception, it's just for the love of the game</center>

#### 5.1

Time for "*overtly altered magical action scene*" number two.

Just as [[Characters/Rosa\|Rosa]] is done talking about wolves and sheep, [[Characters/Gohda\|Gohda]], [[Characters/Shannon\|Shannon]] and [[Characters/Genji\|Genji]] return from the kitchen where they had gone to to carry out their duties, to report the deaths of [[Characters/Nanjo\|Nanjo]] and [[Characters/Kumasawa\|Kumasawa]] in the *[[Mysteries/Episode 2 mysteries/Crime scene in the servant room\|servant room]]*.

When asked about the details of what happened, all three are incapable of giving a coherent answer that would convince her to not shoot at them.
![Pasted image 20250727171850.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250727171850.png)
[[Characters/Rosa\|Rosa]] herself is of course already aware of this part of the plan and is just playing her role as the dispenser of accusations.

Let's get the conservative solution out of the way first. 
This encounter with [[Characters/Kanon\|Kanon]] plainly and simply didn't happen: either [[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]] is dead and [[Characters/X Beatrice\|X Beatrice]] is acting as [[Characters/Shannon\|Shannon]], or she's alive, which would keep the counter of scenes where [[Characters/Shannon\|Shannon]] definitely must be X to zero.

[[Characters/Kumasawa\|Kumasawa]] and [[Characters/Nanjo\|Nanjo]] were killed in the servant room and carried away, then the remaining people threatened Godha by saying that if he doesn't go along with what they say they'll kill him outright or hand him over to [[Characters/Rosa\|Rosa]] as the culprit. Thus the poor guy lied, and very poorly at that, given that he was improvising.

![Pasted image 20250727172638.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250727172638.png)
<center>If you  single out Gohda's sentences you can see that he's just going along with anything Genji says, as if he's scared of saying the wrong thing.</center>

One dent in this theory is Gohda's genuine looking reaction to not finding the corpses in the servant room, as well as the door being locked. 
There's no one left who could have carried out those two actions without him present, so we're left to assume that it's just yet another act, but let's see if we can find a more compelling solution utilizing our "reading B" that solves this problem while mirroring the magical narrative a bit more closely...

For this to make sense it's important to reiterate that, according to all our theories, [[Characters/Gohda\|Gohda]] at this point still has no idea of who's committing the murders, but he does know about the [[Characters/Kanon\|Kanon]]-[[Characters/Shannon\|Shannon]] double identity. You'll quickly see why that's crucial, after all we're about to explain how the two of them might really have been in the same room at the same time.
Warning: We're relying reeeeeeally hard on [[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]] and X being extremely theatrical here. Boy, it sure would help having a good grasp on their motives!

At first they hear a knock, it's' [[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]] dressed as [[Characters/Kanon\|Kanon]] (but no longer identifying as him, [[Characters/Kanon\|Kanon]] is "dead" after all. Or some other explanation we missed that works better.), who's acting wounded just like in [[Long Form Theories/Theory for Legend of the Golden witch#Part 6 They got tired of counting twilights\|the boiler room mystery in Legend]]. 
Godha is immediately freaked out, not just by the blood, but because... what the hell? Isn't [[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]] right there beside him? Who is this person!? 
Of course, he figures he can't talk about [[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]] in front of [[Characters/Nanjo\|Nanjo]], and he assumes the other servants are thinking the same ting. 

They move [[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]] to the servant room and [[Characters/Nanjo\|Nanjo]] starts acting his part of giving [[Characters/Kanon\|Kanon]] medical attention, again, not unlike [[Episodes/Legend of the Golden witch\|Legend]]. 
All the magic chicanery for the rest of the scene is a premeditated performance, including the bags of fake blood used to fake both his wound and the ones he inflicts on [[Characters/Nanjo\|Nanjo]] and [[Characters/Kumasawa\|Kumasawa]], and the spider webs that [[Characters/X Beatrice\|X Beatrice]] uses to drive [[Characters/Kanon\|Kanon]] away.

[[Characters/Gohda\|Gohda]] pinning [[Characters/Kanon\|Kanon]] against the wall is realistic given the difference in their builds and it discredits any narration giving him superhuman abilities.
Meanwhile, it would be a bit far fetched to argue that [[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]] has some light special effects that makes her hands look like blades so we'll just blame the narrator for that, after all nobody mentions them explicitly. The same goes for Genji's throwing knife.

At the end of it [[Characters/Nanjo\|Nanjo]] and [[Characters/Kumasawa\|Kumasawa]] are left in the room still alive, and as soon as the others leave they leave the letter there and flee.

When the trio reports to [[Characters/Rosa\|Rosa]], Godha is in a difficult spot because he knows that person can't be [[Characters/Kanon\|Kanon]], but wouldn't know how to explain it to her.
![Pasted image 20250808181903.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250808181903.png)

They agree to go investigate the servant room. [[Characters/Rosa\|Rosa]] is suspicious, or at least acts like she is, but she notably doesn't seem to give a damn about [[Characters/Maria\|Maria]] seeing the corpses, which of course makes sense if she already knows that there aren't any corpses.

[[Characters/Rosa\|Rosa]] discovering two master keys inside the envelope can be explained in a thousand and one ways, since she, [[Characters/Nanjo\|Nanjo]] and all the master key holders except [[Characters/Gohda\|Gohda]] were in on the plan.
Let's say that during the discovery process, [[Characters/Rosa\|Rosa]] opens the letter and pretends like she found the master key that [[Characters/Nanjo\|Nanjo]] gave her, according to our previous theory.
![Pasted image 20250727180211.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250727180211.png)
<center>After all, the keys after that point are immediatly grouped</center>

---

#### 5.2

As programmed, [[Characters/Rosa\|Rosa]] kicks out the servants. It only makes sense in her position and it's the same thing [[Characters/Natsuhi\|Natsuhi]] did in [[Episodes/Legend of the Golden witch\|Legend]]. It's like poetry, it rhymes.
[[Characters/George\|George]] insists on going with [[Characters/Shannon\|Shannon]], and [[Characters/Rosa\|Rosa]] doesn't object to his choice at all, it's unclear if she was trying to prompt this reaction by mistreating [[Characters/Shannon\|Shannon]] on purpose or if it just happened, either way she doesn't seem to care for George's survival at this point.

The exiled group heads to the kitchen, where they pressure [[Characters/George\|George]] into believing the [[Characters/Kanon\|Kanon]] incident. All of a sudden [[Characters/George\|George]] fancies himself an occultist because he wants to play along with [[Characters/Shannon\|Shannon]]'s superstitions.
![Pasted image 20250810192842.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250810192842.png)

They decide to go look for a mirror in Natsuhi's room, but they handed all the master keys to [[Characters/Rosa\|Rosa]], so the first step is breaking into the chapel from the window to get Natsuhi's key. 


They all leave except [[Characters/Genji\|Genji]], who insists that he wants to stay there alone.
![Pasted image 20250810193744.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250810193744.png)

![Pasted image 20250810193901.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250810193901.png)

![Pasted image 20250810194028.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250810194028.png)

If we follow the version of events where [[Characters/Nanjo\|Nanjo]] and [[Characters/Kumasawa\|Kumasawa]] survived, then we still need to explain how they ended up dead, and this scene of [[Characters/Genji\|Genji]] thinking about his chess game with [[Characters/Nanjo\|Nanjo]] could suggest he stayed behind to meet with them, but then he kills them on [[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]]'s orders and that's what him throwing a knife at the butterfly means. 
If the red truth from [[Episodes/Legend of the Golden witch\|Legend]] about [[Characters/Genji\|Genji]] not being a killer is to be applied here too, then [[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]] did it offscreen. Either way [[Characters/Genji\|Genji]] is tasked with preparing the bodies and reporting their discovery in the courtyard as the seventh and eight twilights.

Of course, none of this matters in case they really did die when we saw them die.

---

#### 5.3

Once George's group breaks into the chapel they are able to find the key, but they also find [[Characters/X Beatrice\|X Beatrice]] who threatens them with big words and butterflies according to the narration, or more likely a shotgun according to us.

The group easily gets away using the door that was supposed to be locked, which makes two violations of the red truth back to back.

> __When the door to the chapel is locked, it prevents any and all methods of entry or exit.__

As mentioned earlier, we can assume that the door was left open, or that [[Characters/Rosa\|Rosa]] handed the key to [[Characters/X Beatrice\|X Beatrice]] during any of their previous encounters.

They are chased by [[Characters/Beatrice\|Beatrice]] and the [[Characters/Goats\|goats]] all the way to *[[Mysteries/Episode 2 mysteries/Crime scene in Natsuhi's room\|Natsuhi's room]]*, where [[Characters/Shannon\|Shannon]] tries to fight them off with her magical girl powers and the mirror mc guffin but in the end loses to the witch's overbearing magical prowess.
![Pasted image 20250810205509.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250810205509.png)

Say the line Bart!
![Pasted image 20250811230516.png|400](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250811230516.png)
*"This scene has been heavily altered by the narrator and everybody involved is either dead or a culprit."*

![Pasted image 20250811230547.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250811230547.png)

This is by all intents and purposes a continuation of the scene in Jessica's room.

Following our reading "A", we reach the conclusion that since at this point [[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]] is already dead, the sudden appearance of [[Characters/X Beatrice\|X Beatrice]] in the chapel represents her dropping the [[Characters/Shannon\|Shannon]] act and attacking [[Characters/George\|George]] and [[Characters/Gohda\|Gohda]]. 
They try to Barricade themselves in Natsuhi's room but fail because the opponents are able to unlock the door and get inside, then after killing them they leave Natsuhi's key on [[Characters/George\|George]] and close the door with a master key.

But how can that possibly be the case when we know that all the master keys never left Rosa's hands?
This is the greatest logic leap required by this otherwise not so out there theory, as well as its greatest weakness, but because we don't see [[Characters/Battler\|Battler]]'s perspective until later when [[Characters/Genji\|Genji]] knocks on the parlor door, it's not impossible to suppose that he and [[Characters/Maria\|Maria]] might have dozed off, giving [[Characters/Rosa\|Rosa]] the opportunity to sneak away and help out with this crime.
That could also explain why he didn't hear any gunshots. Or maybe they were killed in the chapel? And [[Characters/Rosa\|Rosa]] was only necessary to lock Natsuhi's room? Both work.

Let's instead focus on reading "B", let's see if we can avoid having to involve [[Characters/Rosa\|Rosa]].

[[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]] and [[Characters/X Beatrice\|X Beatrice]] are both present in the scene. If the zombie [[Characters/Kanon\|Kanon]] from earlier was [[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]], then it is assumed that [[Characters/Shannon\|Shannon]] went to the bathroom and they switched back at some point. Yes, that's the explanation.
After [[Characters/X Beatrice\|X Beatrice]] attacks them they successfully barricade inside Natsuhi's room, but [[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]] is locked inside with them and uses a weapon prepared in advance to surprise and kill them.

Here the fight scene makes a lot more sense, this is [[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]] having to once again justify to herself  that she is killing [[Characters/George\|George]], and in doing so she is killing [[Characters/Shannon\|Shannon]] too.
What's harder to justify is what happens after. We're not getting away with calling [[Characters/Shannon\|Shannon]]'s corpse fake this time, because [[Characters/Battler\|Battler]] has learned his lesson and actually checks personally.
![Pasted image 20250811185355.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250811185355.png)

Because all keys are accounted for in the red, we are forced to rule out any last minute infighting or a retaliation from the victims. This can only be a suicide, and we have already theorized previously that [[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]] doesn't plan to leave the island alive, or she could have done so at the end of [[Episodes/Legend of the Golden witch\|Legend]]. 

So [[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]] sets up the crime scene with [[Characters/X Beatrice\|X Beatrice]], then she closes herself inside with the key, she puts it in George's pocket, she stains the stake with fake blood and places it on the ground, then she shoots herself in the head, in a way that makes it so the weapon will fall out of sight. 
It's possible the weapon wasn't even a gun, after all she had the surprise factor against both Godha and [[Characters/George\|George]]. Not sure how you set up something that isn't a gun to pierce your skull, but I'm sure it's possible. 

So if this is true, then what [[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]] is carrying out is an elaborated group suicide, and she's creating all the closed rooms for the sake of it.

Earlier we saw this red in one of the tea party debates, which is probably a lot more important than it seems at first. 
![Pasted image 20250810201046.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250810201046.png)
She promised that there is a way of stopping the ritual, in other words [[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]] could be convinced to stop killing if someone told her exactly what she want to hear.

Tying into the topic of promises, this exchange also takes place.
![Pasted image 20250610001650.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250610001650.png)
We believe this focus on witches being sincere and humans being liars refers to a promise that [[Characters/Battler\|Battler]] made to X and it's related to his big mysterious sin.


---
#### 5.4

At this point having to suspect everyone is starting to take a toll on [[Characters/Battler\|Battler]] and he's about to give up on finding a culprit.

![Pasted image 20250810191833.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250810191833.png)

![Pasted image 20250810200153.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250810200153.png)

He finally breaks when back in the parlor [[Characters/Rosa\|Rosa]] sets up a letter and accuses [[Characters/Battler\|Battler]] of being a wolf over it so she can kick him out as well.

![Pasted image 20250810201613.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250810201613.png)

## Part 𝑖: The Banquet
<center>Thanks Battler, for being a weak pathetic coward!</center>
#### 𝑖.1
[[Characters/Battler\|Battler]] has invoked [[Characters/Beatrice\|Beatrice]], and the game is up. At that point he has officially lost the round. 
The scenes we see from this point onward are assumed to be magical in nature and the things shown and said may not match reality even when [[Characters/Battler\|Battler]] is present.

The next time we see [[Characters/Battler\|Battler]], he's getting himself drunk, which will conveniently explain the weird things he's about to see. 
We don't see how the scene with [[Characters/Rosa\|Rosa]] ended, but it can be assumed she didn't want to shoot him (be it on principle or because of [[Characters/Maria\|Maria]]) so she just left to look for [[Characters/X Beatrice\|X Beatrice]].

Battler is accompanied to Kinzo's room by [[Characters/Genji\|Genji]]. There he meets [[Characters/Kinzo\|Kinzo]] and [[Characters/Beatrice\|Beatrice]] having the chess game of their life, and she convinces him that witches exist. It all totally happened, and it was incredibly convincing. Just, we're never shown any of it, of course! :)

![Pasted image 20250706201148.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250706201148.png)
We can't know what actually went down, but [[Characters/Battler\|Battler]] probably did talk to [[Characters/X Beatrice\|X Beatrice]], and their conversation might have been similar to the one they have in [[Episodes/Alliance of the Golden witch\|Alliance]]. Then, at midnight, they are both killed by the big bomb™ (sigh).

As a refresher from the end of [[Episodes/Legend of the Golden witch\|Legend]], we think something was set up to automatically kill any remaining human in the mansion at precisely midnight of the second day. Our best guess is still a powerful ticking bomb, or a bunch of them all over the estate.
This is probably the work of [[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]] and her sponsors outside the island, meanwhile [[Characters/Rosa\|Rosa]] and [[Characters/X Beatrice\|X Beatrice]] probably had no idea, or they would have taken precautions.

---
#### 𝑖.2

It's a couple minutes before midnight, and [[Characters/Rosa\|Rosa]] is frantically looking for [[Characters/Beatrice\|Beatrice]] in the chapel, perhaps she still needs to receive her part of the deal.

![Pasted image 20250706201324.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250706201324.png)
Because she can't find her anywhere, she settles for at least bringing back the gold ingots and tries to run away with [[Characters/Maria\|Maria]]. Sadly it's too late, and they end up getting caught in the explosion before they run far enough.

Tea party [[Characters/Beatrice\|Beatrice]] says she's going to reward [[Characters/Rosa\|Rosa]] for her collaboration, in reference to her being a key accomplice in the events we discussed. 
Of course, as Maria's friend, Beato also has a bone to pick with [[Characters/Rosa\|Rosa]] for her poor treatment of her daughter, so the reward is being tortured in the most horrible ways while being reminded that she left all her siblings to die for her personal gain.

But the torture actually has a second purpose as it motivates [[Characters/Battler\|Battler]] to keep fighting in the next game, thus breaking the stalemate.
You see, as far as the tea party narrative is concerned [[Characters/Battler\|Battler]] has distinctly surrendered to [[Characters/Beatrice\|Beatrice]], and yet he didn't instantly lose, which gives us more context on what the win conditions at play really are. 
It seems that simply getting [[Characters/Battler\|Battler]] to say he believes in witches is not enough, he has to actually *believe* in witches for [[Characters/Beatrice\|Beatrice]] to win, so it's bad for her if he becomes too depressed to keep going.
This is incidentally the same reason why saying "Witches exist and magic is real" in red would only cause a stalemate and force a draw within the logic of the tea party.

#### 𝑖.3

At the highest level of the tea party we see a conversation taking place between [[Characters/Beatrice\|Beatrice]], [[Characters/Bernkastel\|Bernkastel]] and [[Characters/Lambdadelta\|Lambdadelta]]. A version of [[Characters/Battler\|Battler]] before getting his motivation back is observing them as a stand in for the reader

Beato finally calls Bern out on actively favoring [[Characters/Battler\|Battler]], meanwhile Lambda has apparently recruited herself to Beato's side for a chance to fight Bern once again after being defeated.
This project isn't meant to contain any major Higurashi spoilers, so we won't discuss the two of them them in too much detail, suffice it to say they have beef.

That being said, even though they bicker and banter, they don't seem to take the stakes that seriously, almost like they're preparing to play a board game (that's a recurring metaphor huh?). 
Their drive to fight each other comes from cheap pride and a need for entertainment and there's a shared understanding that they're in on it together, after all only boredom can kill a [[Tips/Regarding Voyagers\|voyager]] witch.

After they split up, both [[Characters/Bernkastel\|Bernkastel]] and [[Characters/Lambdadelta\|Lambdadelta]] have a one on one talk with reader [[Characters/Battler\|Battler]].

Let's examine Bern first, she starts by giving [[Characters/Battler\|Battler]] a pep talk, but more importantly she makes the point that we've been referencing about [[Characters/Beatrice\|Beatrice]] making suboptimal moves.

Apparently there's a very big weakness in Turn: this might refer to her deliberately not countering an attack, but it's not really a flaw and it doesn't get exploited later. The truth is... there are so many little holes in the story, and this could refer to any of them. It's likely something we already discussed at some point.

[[Characters/Lambdadelta\|Lambdadelta]] shows up next and immediately thrash talks him and [[Characters/Bernkastel\|Bernkastel]], but she still gives him some very valuable hints. We don't need to guess her reason for doing so because it's clearly spelled out in [[Episodes/Alliance of the Golden witch\|Alliance]], she wants the confrontation to keep going indefinitely so when [[Characters/Battler\|Battler]] looks like he might deadlock the game she has to step in and help him.

She refers to [[Characters/Battler\|Battler]] as Bern's piece, he is her subordinate in the grand scheme of things , then Lambda reiterates all the flaws with Beato's game plan.

Basically, as we've been saying, the culprit isn't looking for the most efficient ways of killing everyone, she will make sure that each case looks mysterious, add unnecessary preparations like the halloween decorations in the chapel, or go out of her way to deceive somebody who is going to die soon after. From Lambda's perspective all of this is just "Taking worthless pieces".

"Place excess pieces on the board" refers to the addition of [[Characters/X Beatrice\|X Beatrice]] to this game. While she played a major role here, her not being in [[Episodes/Legend of the Golden witch\|Legend]] means she isn't required in the grand scheme of things.

<center>Batora no b..baka!</center>

Since we've already foreshadowed the next two episodes a bunch of times, there's no point in hiding it. Lambda is just putting up the facade of a dumb tsundere when she interacts with Bern and [[Characters/Battler\|Battler]], even when she inadvertently calls herself an moron with a japanese pun.
But if that's the case, who's to say [[Characters/Bernkastel\|Bernkastel]]'s thoughtful sympathy is genuine?

So. [[Characters/Battler\|Battler]], once again, is a pathetic coward. What a shock!
Our Banquet theory will be ready in due time (trust), in which we'll have to tackle the most difficult part of Umineko to us, the epitaph. But did we manage to figure out something? You'll see... Until then, see you next time!
