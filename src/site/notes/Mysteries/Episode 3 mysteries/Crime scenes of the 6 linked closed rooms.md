### Axioms
While she doesn't repeat it in red every time, all six rooms will be assumed to fit Beatrice's definition of a [[Speculation/Beatrice's Definitions\|closed room]].

Banquet
- __There are five__ (master keys)__, one for each servant__
- __Furthermore, all of the doors and windows on the six rooms are normal. No device exists which can lock them without a key, such as an auto lock.__
- __These six are all dead: [[Characters/Kinzo\|Kinzo]], [[Characters/Genji\|Genji]], [[Characters/Shannon\|Shannon]], [[Characters/Kanon\|Kanon]], [[Characters/Gohda\|Gohda]], [[Characters/Kumasawa\|Kumasawa]]!__
- __There is no one hiding in the six rooms!__
- __The six died instantly!__ By died instantly she means "The targets instantly became incapable of action after being attacked."
- ([[Characters/Ronove\|Ronove]])__Only the victims are inside the rooms, and no other people exist inside the rooms.__
- __The six were not killed by traps__!
---
Alliance
-  __All five master keys were discovered, each in the pocket of one of the servants! The individual room keys were found inside envelopes alongside the corpses! In short, all keys related to the linked closed rooms were locked inside the linked closed rooms!! No key could have been returned from outside the room using the crack of the door, the crack of the window, vents or any place of the sort!!__
- __All of them had what appeared to be gunshot wounds that were fatal! Murdering them from outside the room would have been impossible!! I shall say more with the red! When the five other than Kinzo were killed, the killer was definitely in the same room as them! I already proclaimed in red at the time that there were no suicides!!__

| Discovery Order | Character | Discovery Room         |
| --------------- | --------- | ---------------------- |
| #1              | Shannon   | Parlor                 |
| #2              | Kumasawa  | 2nd floor guest room   |
| #3              | Gohda     | 3rd floor waiting room |
| #4              | Kinzo     | Boiler room            |
| #5              | Genji     | 2nd floor VIP room     |
| #6              | Kanon     | Chapel                 |

### Corollaries
All the rooms where (at least) a servant with (at least) a key has been found, are linked closed rooms.

Even if we suppose __"the linked closed rooms"__ only include five rooms out of the six, and we collapse Shannon and Kanon into Sayo, she still must have died in one of the 5 rooms.
We solve this by semantically declaring Kanon and Shannon dead despite Sayo being alive like we did in Turn. She was shot during a disagreement and is wounded, and according to the red they only __appeared__ to be fatally wounded.

Additionally, a 7th unconscious person being present out of sight next to Sayo solves it (not hiding, just unconscious).

Other points of flexibility are the definition of the word "corpse" and "The linked closed rooms" possibly being be the name of the mystery and not a property of the rooms.
