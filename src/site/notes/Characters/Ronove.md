Ronove
![Mugshots/ronove.png|ronove.png](/img/user/Mugshots/ronove.png)
# Descriptions


## Banquet
#### Tea Party

One of the 72 Great Demons. Works for a Master in exchange for various forms of compensation. He currently has a contract with [[Characters/Beatrice\|Beatrice]] as her butler (head furniture).

He's become proficient at housekeeping after serving in many households, so his ability as a butler is very high.

In the high society of witches, employing him has become a kind of status symbol. Furthermore, the cookies he bakes are superb, and witches will often form a line demanding them.

He must possess tremendous magical power, but since he always stays out of the spotlight to further boost his Master's reputation, his combat capabilities are unknown.

# Theories


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



> [!note]- Ronove is the meta counterpart of Genji
> [[Characters/Ronove\|Ronove]] is closely related to [[Characters/Genji\|Genji]], although they are two distinct entities in the magical interpretation.
> 
> **Evidence:**
> - Genji's last name is Ronoue.
> - When Genji is described as Furniture in [[Characters/Genji#Turn\|Genji#Turn#Tea Party]], it is mentioned that an high ranking demon helped [[Characters/Kinzo\|Kinzo]] in his construction. 
> 	- The idea that unlike [[Characters/Shannon\|Shannon]] and [[Characters/Kanon\|Kanon]] he wasn't totally Kinzo's creation maybe hints at the fact that unlike them, [[Characters/Genji\|Genji]] wasn't raised with this framing and only later developed his devotion to the role for unknown reasons.
> - When [[Characters/Ronove\|Ronove]] fights [[Characters/Jessica\|Jessica]] in alliance, she mistakes him for [[Characters/Genji\|Genji]], then he calls the servant his "little brother" and "vessel", not unlike [[Characters/Virgilia\|Virgilia]] and [[Characters/Kumasawa\|Kumasawa]].

> [!note]- Knowledge of the loops
> Every meta character who sees and references events from multiple episodes is somebody who is aware of the [[Mysteries/Future mysteries/Bottled letters\|Bottled letters]] that have been found in the future.
> 
> This would include:
> - Sayo as Beatrice, Kanon and Shannon
> - \[REDACTED\] as herself
> - Genji as himself and as Ronove
> - Kumasawa as Virgilia
> - Ange (retroactively from the future)
> - EVA Beatrice (either retroactively or because she was actually present there)
> - Possibly Nanjo as Gaap (Gaanjo)
> 
> We notably can't make this claim about Kinzo and Maria.
