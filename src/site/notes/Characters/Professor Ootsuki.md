# Descriptions

## Alliance
#### Future

A professor at a certain college, well known as an authority on the subject of Western folklore.

He's also famous for his hobby, researching the Rokkenjima Witch Legend as one of the Witch Hunters.

The primary focus of the Witch Hunt is the pasting together of occult stories to try and make them match with the Rokkenjima incident, making it much more of a mental game for dilettantes and enthusiasts of the mystical than a scientific investigation into the truth of the crime.
