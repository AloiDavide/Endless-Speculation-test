## Actual theory


> [!note]+ Legend is the "canonical" version of the events.
> We were asked on more than one occasion which episode we expected to be the "real" one.
> We don't know how many if any more games will happen in the answer arcs, so we choose Legend as the most likely candidate from the question arcs.
>  
> ---
> Leads:
> - The first tea party is a direct continuation of Legend, and every following interaction between Battler and Beatrice is framed as a continuation of that one.
> - Beatrice, Shannon and Kanon claim to have seen countless loops already, but this is merely the same magic fluff as the witch killing and reviving someone 100 times.
> - It's not really a question you would ask unless you knew there is an answer.


> [!note]+ The "canonical" version of the events will be the one where Battler wins the game.
> We just haven't seen it yet, because the mystery hasn't been solved.
> 
> ---
> Leads:
> - If the truth about what transpired on Rokkenjima were to be revealed, that means Battler will have won and the black box will be broken.
> - The framing of the [[Bottled letters in the future\|Bottled letters in the future]] would suggest that Legend is yet another letter, but who says that any of them recount the real story?

## Q&A
- [x] There's something that doesn't feel right with Kanon's presentation, especially him saying "...even I..." and when they ask him his age
We don't know
- [x] Who has Kinzo's seal?
Sayo.
- [x] Kumasawa and Rosa say that the only one that can take care of and talk with with Kinzo is Genji
It's because, even before Kinzo's death, he become increasingly distrustful of parents.
- [x] Rosa gifts black tea to Natsuhi
Ok.
- [x] Why do the servant pass down the tale about golden butterflies and various paranormal effects?
Because at least Sayo and Genji are interested in forwarding a magic narrative, and have been planting seeds of it for a while.
- [x] Who gave the letter and the Umbrella to Maria?
It's Sayo.
- [x] Why does the Beato in the letter call herself an Alchemist
Because she gave the gold to Kinzo. Why doesn't she call herself a witch at that point? Is the person who is writing the letter X Beatrice?
- [x] Why does Rudolph say ""Tonight I will probably be killed""
Despite him dying immediatly, he was bribed by Sayo to partecipare in the killing. He expects that he could die in this dangerous game but he accepts the risk with money as assurance that would go to Ange. Maybe he thinks that Battler won't be killed.
- [x] What about the shift change? Godha is now at the nightshift on the mansion, Shannon and Kanon on the guesthouse, Kumasawa and Genji sleep in the guesthouse. Apparently the shifts at the guesthouse and at the mansion have been completelly reversed. Originally, Kanon and Shannon were on the mansion, the nightshift on the guesthouse was assigned to godha, Kumasawa was sleeping in the guesthouse and Genji was sleeping in the mansion.
This is all a lie so they can forward Sayo's plan. None of this is real.
- [x] Does the panoramic before midnight mean anything at all?
I don't think so? Maybe? But I don't think so.
- [x] How do all the adults die?
The servants come in the room and shoot shoot shoot. Eva and Hideyoshi knew they should live.
- [ ] What's the red liquid on Natsuhi's door?
- [x] Why is the phone dead?
Either it's not actually dead, or more probably Sayo and the gang are unplugging it.
- [x] Why does Jessica run to the storehouse immediatly, without knowing it was where she was supposed to go?
It's not really clear this is what's happening.
- [x] Why is there red painting on the storehouse? Why are there symbols that Maria knows?
It's the narrative of the endless witch, and in part, for some reason, these deaths are made to look like magic. The reason seems to be to convince Battler.
- [x] Why do all of the adults insist the kids don't come inside?
Eva and Hideyoshi knows that Sayo's body is fake and don't want anyone to come close. Natsuhi doesn't want the children to see a corpse.
- [x] What about "Shannon's corpse"?
Hideyoshi invents an excuse to not make George come close. Hideyoshi knows about the ring either because it's possible to guess that he would gift her a fiamond ring once she asks for what's on her finger or because Rudolph heard him practicing proposing in the bathroom and told hideyoshi.
- [x] What's the blood that Kumasawa says is in the dining room?
She's cleaning the blood of the murders that happened the previous night, which of course they committed.
- [x] Why does Maria ask "did someone die?"
This is not what she says, she asks Jessica who died, and that's after someone already talked about killings. In general it seems like Maria has already been primed with the possibility of killings. After all she's absorbing some black witch vibe.
- [x] Why do Kanon, Genji, Kumasawa and Maria look at a point behind Battler?
Because they're all trying to forward a narrative, one that Maria actually believes in. to her, Betrice is there, because Sayo is there.
- [x] Why does maria say that Beato promised to play with her?
Why the fuck did I write this down, probably because she did???
- [x] What about the envelope below Eva and Hideyoshi's room?
It was put there by Sayo's gang.
- [x] What about the red signs?
It's painted by Sayo's gang.
- [x] What about their murder?
Killed by Sayo and gang. She thought she was fake, but she didn't realize they wouldn't hesitate to kill her too.
- [x] What happened in the boiler room with Kanon?
Nanjo lied about Kanon being died.
- [x] How did Kinzo's corpse get there?
It was thrown there before the Eva thingy to give an excuse to separate.
- [x] Why does Maria tell them that she got told that she'll resurrect everyone soon?
She bought the black magicky narrative about killing and resurrecting everyone.
- [x] Letter in Kinzo's study, how did it get there?
Genji, Kumasawa or Nanjo put it there.
- [x] Why does the phone stop working and then start working again? Who's calling?
Either it never stopped working or it was repaired by Sayo.
- [x] Why are the deaths so similar to the epitaph?
Sayo is, for some reason, interested in making them look similar to the epitaph.
- [x] Why are all the red symbols so similar to what's in maria's diary and in Kinzo's book?
They belong to the same black witchy narrative.
- [x] parlor murders?
Sayo comes and kills everyone with a shotgun after saying Maria to turn and sing. Kumasawa and Nanjo very clearly didn't see it coming.
- [x] What about Maria's singing?
She was told to sing by Sayo.
- [x] Why does Natsuhi disappear?
She actually finds a letter written by the culprit, which tells her to come in front of the portrait for a final showdown. We can't come up with anything better.
- [x] Natsuhi's death
Death by shotgun, It's very possible that both her and Sayo died in the shootout.
- [x] Ending
- [x] Why are there pieces of everyone in Rokkenjima?
BOMB
- [x] What about Maria's letter
They were pre prepared by Sayo, she gave them to Kuwabara Kuwabara and told him to spread them around.
- [x] Why does Battler start by saying "Hey everyone, congratulations on finishing "Umineko no naku koro ni"! Man I still didn't have a clue what was going on when the story ended!"
It's still a meta battler, even before the whole Beato thing it's still a charachter that was engaging with a story.
- [x] What does it mean that Beatrice isn't "one individual woman"
It means that she's not just a charachter in the story, she is a core part of the narrative. there were multiple Beatrice for example, and both Kanon and Shannon are Beatrice.
- __I guarantee the identities of all unidentified corpses. Therefore, there were no body double tricks!__ (Said Beato)
- **Genji, Kumasawa, and Nanjo are not killers!**
