[[Characters/Beatrice\|Beato]] defines hidden doors during the [[Mysteries/Episode 2 mysteries/Crime scene in the chapel\|Chapel]] debate
> [!NOTE] Hidden door
> "A hidden door refers to an entrance that cannot be recognized by those who do not know of it. Even children knows that."

Beatrice defines the closed rooms during the [[Mysteries/Episode 3 mysteries/Crime scenes of the 6 linked closed rooms\|Crime scenes of the 6 linked closed rooms]] debate.
> [!NOTE] Closed room
> The term 'closed room' refers to a room where the inside and the outside are completely cut off from each other. Naturally, it will be impossible to even affect things across that boundary line, much less enter or escape across it. This includes an all-inclusive denial of the existence of [[Speculation/Beatrice's Definitions\|hidden doors]], as well as all possibility of intervention from the outside. Henceforth, this shall be referred to as... 'Beatrice's Closed Room Definition'!"{ #45ecae}


And when asked about the definition of intervention from outside:
> [!NOTE] Direct intervention
> "I refer to all types of direct intervention from the outside, such as using a fishing line or a long, thin rod. In conclusion, there are no gaps in the doors and windows through which such tricks will work."

She then clarifies:
> [!NOTE] Closed Room: Addendum
> I'll add to this definition that interference due to radio waves and related methods of remote control shall be impossible.
> The phones are already unusable, are they not? Ah, whatever. I'll include that too. All direct and indirect methods of interfering with the inside of the closed room from the outside of the room are impossible.
> ...Even though it's a closed room, it probably isn't impossible for someone to knock or call out. The closed room definition does not cover whether transmission of intent across the boundary is possible or not.
