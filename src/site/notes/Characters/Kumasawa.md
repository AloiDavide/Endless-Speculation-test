This elderly woman is a part-timer who, though she has quit her job several times along the way, has served the family for a great many years in total.

She is crafty and more than competent when it comes to performing her duties, but because of her chattiness and love of rumors, she is not highly regarded as a servant.

Her corpse was found in the [[Mysteries/Episode 1 mysteries/Rose garden storehouse\|Rose garden storehouse]].

# Theories

> [!note]- Virgilia is the meta counterpart of Kumasawa
> Like with [[Characters/Genji\|Genji]] and [[Characters/Ronove\|Ronove]], the author has left some very explicit hints to the point that it doesn't even count as deduction.
> 
> ---
> Leads:
> - Virgilia transforms out of Kumasawa on her first appearance on the game board, it's hard to argue with that.
> - She mentions being really old, but she looks quite young in her witch form.
> - Mackerel jokes
> 	- ![Pasted image 20250413161435.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250413161435.png)
> - She is a mentor figure for [[Characters/Shannon\|Shannon]] and [[Characters/Kanon\|Kanon]], aka. [[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]].

> [!note]- Sayo's required accomplices all have a motive to help
> The other servants plus Nanjo all have motivations to be accomplices of Beatrice.

> Leads:
> - Genji would do anything related to Kinzo's will. Or alternatively he's following Sayo as his new master after Kinzo died because he sees her, Beatrice, as the true heir.
> - Nanjo wants money for his sick grand daughter and Ange shows us that's exactly what his family received.
> - Kumasawa's family also got the money, and she has a personal attachment to Sayo.
> - Gohda will comply if threatened, he probably isn't even in on the plan from the start.
> - This is probably circular evidence, but Ronove Viriglia and Gaap are shown taking orders from Beatrice, implying a relationship of servitude.
