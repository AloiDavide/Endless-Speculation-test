Eplain the [[Bottled letters in the future\|Bottled letters in the future]]


---

- [x] Who writes the character descriptions in Alliance?
Sometimes Beatrice sometimes the Chiesters?
- [x] Why do the sibilings now know to ask Natsuhi and Krauss to see Kinzo?
Sayo gave the information to one of the sibilings, which shared it to everyone else
- [x] Why didn't Ange die by jumping off a building?
She did
- [x] What about Amakusa?
What *about* Amakusa
- [x] What does it mean that Maria searching for the rose keeps happening every loop?
Possibly she was told to do so by Sayo
- [x] Anti-Rosa?
It's the name of a company
- [x] What does the ticket for Atami from Rosa mean?
Rosa was seeing her lover
- [x] Message in a bottle?
They were pre prepared by Sayo, she gave them to Kuwabara Kuwabara and told him to spread them around.
- [x] How does Lambdadelta stopping Ange from saying her name works?
This was probably a rule that was created when ANGE entered the game by Lambdadelta
- [x] What does Rosa being in vacation to sapporo mean?
She was seeing her lover.
- [x] Amakusa golf club
Nothing, unless it means something we missed. Maybe he's the one killing all of Kasumi's men with a sniper rifle.
- [x] What's the deal about everyone needing to be at the guesthouse except for the kids? Apparently it has something to do with some announcement by Kinzo
Shannon says so, it's part of her plan. She wants to set up that magic scene.
- [x] How is that Kinzo is the one giving the umbrella to Maria?
Sayo tells Maria "she, this umbrella is being given to you by your grandfather"
- [x] Why does Rosa say that Maria said that Kinzo is the one who gave her the umbrella?
Maria told her so
- [x] Why did they pick up on the fact that Kinzo is dead only on alliance?
Sayo told an adult
- [x] Why does Genji die immediatly?
He doesn't have to die immediatly
- [x] What about the call to the Kids?
Krauss rounded everybody up with Excuse of having them meet Kinzo.
He's in a deal with Sayo, which requires he obeys her magic plot.
- [x] Does it matter that all medical records of Kinzo are gone? This info is from the future.
It's probaly part of Krauss hiding the fact that his father was dead
- [x] What about the letters to Nanjo, Kumasawa and Ange?
It's a compensation for having partecipated in Sayo's plot
- [ ] What about the photo that Kumasawa has of the text on the chapel?
- [x] Since Ange got the letter, and that probably means that Sayo has nothing to do with Fake Eva's plot, who is plotting that? The idea is that Fake eva would have no reason to send money to Ange.
Okonogi is in Kahoots with Kuwabara Kuwabara, they want to make the plot happen by planting a fake Eva
- [x] How is Kawabata both a boat pilot and a plane pilot? Does this mean anything?
It means something for sure, we just couldn't figure out what it means.
- [x] What's in the display case? Is it Sakutarou?
Yes it is.
- [x] How does Godha and Kumasawa's death work?
They were pretending to die for Battler's sake, but they were then shot by Sayo
- [x] What does Jessica's call mean?
She was forced to play a script by her father/Sayo. Battler's life/Kanon's life were treathened.
- [x] What does Kyrie's call mean?
She was forced to play a script by Krauss/Sayo. Battler's life was threathened.
- [x] Did the test for the next head really take place?
	- Only Genji and Nanjo would have any interest in it, provided they aren't helping Sayo kill everybody.
I think it's only Sayo's take on "magic exists". The cousins were killed by Nanjo and Genji.
- [x] What does that screenshot with Bernkastel and Maria in the explanation of the goats mean? wtf does little girl little girl pant pant mean?
It probably means nothing, regardless we know that Maria knows about Bernkastel, so we need no additional element to make that connection.
- [x] Why the fuck does everyone tell Battler that *magic* did it
They were forced to by Krauss/Sayo
- [x] How did George die?
Shot by Nanjo
- [x] what about the call between Beato and Battler?
X Beatrice calls Battler
- [x] What's battler's sin
He forgot about a promise he made to X Beatrice
- [x] When X Beatrice says she'll leave the game board, does it mean she kills herself?
Yes she does
- [x] What's the resolution to the red about Battler's parents?
Battler is Kyrie's son, there was a switch of children.
- [x] Is Battler's sin that he denied magic 6 years ago?
Possibly
- [x] Why did Kuwabara Kuwabara bring expensive woman articles to Kuwadorian?
Because 0 Beatrice was there
- [x] Why did the movement in Kuwadorian stop in 1968?
Because 0 Beatrice died
- [x] What does it mean that Kasumi is there?
She is looking for Ange
- [x] What about the black witch?
She's a way to cope by hurting other people
- [x] What is black magic?
It's cope by being sadistic to other people. and much more.
- [x] Are the trip in the future and the game of alliance happening at the same time?
Yes. This might mean that the trip in the future is another meta (but grounded) thing and Ange is already dead by jumping off the skyscraper.
- [x] What is Bernkastel? Is she some kind of will to solve the mistery of Rokkenjima?
More or less
- [x] What's Beato's wincon?
Battler needs to remember his sin. Either this or it's something of literally impossible.
- [x] 6 corpses of the dining hall's death
They were set up there later by Sayo

- [x] Krauss death
In the end, he was betrayed by Sayo and killed
- [x] Nanjo's death
She was killed by Sayo/Krauss
- [x] Shannon's death
It's X Beatrice's corpse, that killed herself after she realized that Battler didn't remember his sin
- [x] Kinzo's corpse in the boiler room
It was planted there
- [x] Final question, who is Beatrice?
It's Sayo, but that doesn't explain the red
- [x] How did Battler die?
Killed by the BOMB. Sayo activated it possibly way before, then she dies first because she was closer to the bomb, or maybe she killed herself beforehand.
