## Legend
- __[[Characters/Maria\|Maria]], who was in the same room, did not kill them! And of course, their three deaths were homicides!__
- __I guarantee the identities of all unidentified corpses. Therefore, there were no body double tricks!__
- __[[Characters/Genji\|Genji]], [[Characters/Kumasawa\|Kumasawa]], and [[Characters/Nanjo\|Nanjo]] are not killers__!
---
## Turn
### Axioms
__Only the five master keys were left, and 'Rosa' was holding all of them__! __and let me say this: the parlor's the same__. __The key to the parlor itself is sealed away in the servant's room__. __So unlocking it without a master key is impossible! The definition of a closed room remains the same as always!__

> [!note]- The servants were betrayed in the parlor
> Sayo couldn't get into the study because it was locked, so she had to turn on her allies as a means to reach her goal... no, as a goal to reach her means.
> 
> After killing them she started the phone call, left the room, and locked it the same way she opened it. With a master key.

> Leads:
> - Gengi, Kumasawa and Nanjo had accepted their exile from the study without much of a fuss. They didn't think they were in much danger.
> - The parlor was supposedly locked too, but the culprit would have had a master key, and it's possible the three let the intruder in willingly thinking it was an ally.
> - Without any red truth regarding the master keys, this is not a closed room at all.

> [!note]- Genji, Kumasawa, and Nanjo are not killers
> - Nanjo wasn't directly involved in any killing, all he did was lie.
> - Kumasawa likewise didn't kill anybody herself, she would have been overpowered. Even if we suppose she attacked Kanon, he didn't die.
> - This is a problem for Genji, but maybe one person is enough to carry out the murders and he just watches?

> Alternatively this red isn't so broad and it only refers to that scene in the parlor.
