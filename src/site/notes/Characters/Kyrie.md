# Descriptions

## Legend
#### Rokkenjima

[[Characters/Rudolf\|Rudolf]]’s second wife.

She had already worked alongside him for some time before the death of his first wife, at which time she openly took the position of his wife.

She has served as Rudolf’s right hand in several shady pieces of business, guiding them to success. She is quick-thinking and well-trusted by her husband.

---
Her corpse was found inside the [[Mysteries/Episode 1 mysteries/Rose garden storehouse\|Rose garden storehouse]]. Her face seems to have been smashed after her death.

She was chosen by the Demons’ Roulette. That’s all there is to it.
## Turn
#### Rokkenjima

[[Characters/Rudolf\|Rudolf]]’s second wife.

She had already worked alongside him for some time before the death of his first wife, at which time she openly took the position of his wife.

She has served as Rudolf’s right hand in several shady pieces of business, guiding them to success. She is quick-thinking and well-trusted by her husband.

---
Her corpse was found in the [[Mysteries/Episode 2 mysteries/Crime scene in the chapel\|Chapel]].  
The direct cause of death is unknown, but it seems her stomach was cut open and her intestines pulled out after her death.  
On top of that, sweets and candies were packed into her stomach.  

And so, I give you the land of dreams.  
Happy Halloween.
## Banquet
#### Rokkenjima

[[Characters/Rudolf\|Rudolf]]’s second wife.

She had already worked alongside him for some time before the death of his first wife, at which time she openly took the position of his wife.

She has served as Rudolf’s right hand in several shady pieces of business, guiding them to success. She is quick-thinking and well-trusted by her husband.

---
Died in the [[Mysteries/Hall\|Hall]] of the mansion, her stomach pierced by a [[Characters/The Seven Stakes of Purgatory\|stake-shaped weapon]].  

The stomach isn't a particularly lethal spot.  
Isn't it enough to just kill her in some other, easier way and stick a stake in her corpse?
## Alliance
#### Rokkenjima

[[Characters/Rudolf\|Rudolf]]’s second wife.

She had already worked alongside him for some time before the death of his first wife, at which time she openly took the position of his wife.

She has served as Rudolf’s right hand in several shady pieces of business, guiding them to success. She is quick-thinking and well-trusted by her husband.

---
Her corpse was found in a guest room deep within the mansion.  
There was a single hole right in the center of her forehead. It's probably reasonable to assume she was shot with a [[Characters/The Chiester Sisters Imperial Guard Corps\|gun]] or something similar.  

A [[Characters/The Seven Stakes of Purgatory\|demon stake]] was buried in the hole in her forehead, but it's hard to imagine that this was the cause of death.  

I didn’t miss! I missed on purpose to tease her, nyeh...!
