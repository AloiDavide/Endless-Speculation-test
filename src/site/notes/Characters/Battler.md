# Descriptions

## Legend
### Rokkemjima

The son of [[Characters/Rudolf\|Rudolf]] and his first wife, [[Characters/Ushiromiya Asumu\|Ushiromiya Asumu]].

When his father married a second wife shortly after Asumu’s death, Battler rebelled and went to live with his grandparents on his mother’s side. However, both of these grandparents passed away, and he has now returned to the Ushiromiya family after six years.

This family conference is a chance for him to renew his friendship with his cousins after a six-year gap.

---
This fool made the world where everyone could be happy all come to nothing.

Though [[Characters/Beatrice\|Beatrice]] is extremely angry, she also seems to be enjoying herself immensely. It’s almost as though she’s waited a thousand years to get her hands on a toy as fun as this one.

Hopefully, even this fool will be able to see you before too long...
## Turn
#### Rokkenjima

The son of [[Characters/Rudolf\|Rudolf]] and his first wife, [[Characters/Ushiromiya Asumu\|Ushiromiya Asumu]].

When his father married a second wife shortly after Asumu’s death, Battler rebelled and went to live with his grandparents on his mother’s side. However, both of these grandparents passed away, and he has now returned to the Ushiromiya family after six years.

This family conference is a chance for him to renew his friendship with his cousins after a six-year gap.

Missing.  

He did surrender to the witch at one point, but he pulled himself together and regained his will to fight.  

I see... So, to witches, Battler makes a great toy for smashing.  
That explains why she's always breaking him, fixing him, and breaking him again.  

Torture is meaningless if you kill the subject.  
You've gotta alternate between causing pain and letting them rest.
#### Tea Party

An unfortunate young man whom Beatrice has taken a liking to.  
A human who inherited the black blood from [[Characters/Kinzo\|Kinzo]].  

The massive resistance to magical power Kinzo was born with was passed on to Battler. Ironically, it was this trait that made it so hard for Kinzo to succeed as a magician.  

A massive defensive power against magic can be, even by itself, decisive in a battle against a witch.  

Kinzo has begun to lose this power with age, but young Battler’s power is still on the rise.  

Perhaps it’s understandable that Beatrice tried to crush it as soon as possible.
## Banquet
#### Rokkenjima

The son of [[Characters/Rudolf\|Rudolf]] and his first wife, [[Characters/Ushiromiya Asumu\|Ushiromiya Asumu]].

When his father married a second wife shortly after Asumu’s death, Battler rebelled and went to live with his grandparents on his mother’s side. However, both of these grandparents passed away, and he has now returned to the Ushiromiya family after six years.

This family conference is a chance for him to renew his friendship with his cousins after a six-year gap.

Shot to death by Ushiromiya [[Characters/Eva\|Eva]] inside the mansion.  

The weapon was a [[Tips/Winchester M1984 Sawed off\|Winchester]] from [[Characters/Kinzo\|Kinzo]]'s collection.  

[[Characters/Jessica\|Jessica]] had lost her eyesight. Alone with Battler.  

Wolves and sheep puzzle.
## Alliance
#### Rokkenjima

The son of [[Characters/Rudolf\|Rudolf]] and his first wife, [[Characters/Ushiromiya Asumu\|Ushiromiya Asumu]].

When his father married a second wife shortly after Asumu’s death, Battler rebelled and went to live with his grandparents on his mother’s side. However, both of these grandparents passed away, and he has now returned to the Ushiromiya family after six years.

This family conference is a chance for him to renew his friendship with his cousins after a six-year gap.

Missing.  

Went to hell embraced by the witch.  
But to the witch, that hell was the [[Speculation/Golden Land\|Golden Land]].

### Battler's sin
- (Battler) __Six years ago, no person called Beatrice existed for me.__
- __The sin I am now demanding that you remember is not between Ushiromiya Battler and Beatrice.__
- __Ushiromiya Battler has a sin__
- __Because of your sin, people die.__
- __Due to your sin, a great many humans on this island die. No one escapes, all die.__


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



> [!note]- Battler's sin is denying magic
> Battler's sin from 6 years ago is him destroying someone's Golden Land like Ange did with Maria as a child. This eventually led to [[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]]'s actions, however she is not the person directly wounded by this act.
> 
> ---
> Leads:
> - The sin is not between him and Beatrice. This could mean Sayo didn't yet identify as Beatrice, but there is a better way of making this fit by saying the sin was actually against \[REDACTED\].

</div></div>



<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



>[!tip]- Battler's sin was against [[Characters/X Beatrice\|X Beatrice]]
> It was [[Characters/X Beatrice\|X beato]], not [[Characters/Sayo\|Sayo]], who had a coping mechanism that Battler destroyed.
> 
> ---
> Leads:
> - The sin is not between him and Beatrice, who we associate with Sayo.
> - She is the one talking to Battler in reality during that scene. She has the outfit and at that point Sayo is probably dead, (although we're not 100% on that).
> - In the meta layer she is the one with regrets about the sin, and she looks hurt after he doesn't remember.
> - Crunter said so and that's the best answer we got.

### Battler's identity
- (Battler) __My name is Ushiromiya Battler__.
- (Beato) __I am the golden witch Beatrice. And I opened this game in order to fight Ushiromiya Kinzo's grandchild, Ushiromiya Battler.__
- (Battler) __Ushiromiya Battler's mother is Ushiromiya Asumu.__
- (Battler) __My name is Ushiromiya Battler__
- (Battler) __It was from Ushiromiya Asumu that Ushiromiya Battler is born.__
- Battler tries to repeat "It was from Ushiromiya Asumu that I was born" but he can only say __It was from Ushiromiya__......nghu, ......?!
- __You are not Ushiromiya Asumu's son__.

> [!tip]- Battler is Kyrie's biological son
> Battler is the son of [[Characters/Kyrie\|Kyrie]] and [[Characters/Rudolf\|Rudolf]]. He and [[Characters/Ushiromiya Asumu\|Ushiromiya Asumu]]'s stillborn son had their identities switched by somebody, possibly Rudolf in order to justify his choice of wife.

### Battler's death in Alliance
- __Ushiromiya Battler. I will now... kill you.__
- __And right now, there is no one other than you on this island. The only one alive on this island is you. Nothing outside the island can interfere.__
- __You are all alone on this island. And of course, I am not you. Yet I am here, now, and am about to kill you.__
- What am I?

> [!tip]- Random ideas about Battler's death
> Is it Beatrice as a concept? The rules of this world from [[Tips/Bernkastel's letter\|Bernkastel's letter]] and [[Tips/Memoirs by lady Lambdadelta\|Memoirs by lady Lambdadelta]]. 
> Sure, but that's magic. What is the human trick? It has to be some kind of preprepared device.
> - The same thing that kills Nanjo in [[Episodes/Banquet of the Golden witch\|Banquet]]?
> 	- No, that one is confirmed to be a direct homicide, but this time there was nobody alive.
> - The same thing that kills Natsuhi at the end of [[Legend of the Golden witch\|Legend]]?
> 	- Not necessarily, Sayo with a regular gun is enough to explain that.
> - The same thing that kills the survivors of the game at the end of legend turn and banquet?
> 	- Likely yes, but in that case how did it get Maria and Rosa in Turn when they were already running far away?
> 	- Whatever it is, this thing was so destructive it left no remains except for Maria's jaw.
